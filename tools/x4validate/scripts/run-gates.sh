# Run the contributor gates, and SAY WHAT WAS NOT RUN.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 2026-08-28 there were 27 gates and no runner -- and a
# count in a comment goes stale the moment one is added, so the roster below is
# discovered from gates/*.py and the live count is printed, never asserted. CI cannot
# help -- ci.yml states it: the gates need a real X4 install. So they ran when
# someone remembered, which makes every gate's coverage a matter of chance rather
# than of process. A gate nobody runs is indistinguishable from a gate that passes.
#
# The contract this inherits from the tools themselves: a run that examined less
# than everything must SAY SO. Skipped gates are named, with the reason, and the
# buckets sum to the population -- never a bare "all green".
#
#   scripts/run-gates.sh            quick gates only (seconds to ~1 min each)
#   scripts/run-gates.sh --all      everything, including the ~55 min sweep
#   scripts/run-gates.sh --list     show the roster and exit
#
# Exit: 0 everything attempted PASSED and everything attempted RAN
#       1 a gate failed
#       2 nothing ran at all
#       3 every gate that ran passed, but some COULD NOT RUN -- not a clean
#         sweep. Split out because 0 said 'fine' over gates that examined
#         nothing, which is the same conflation the tools themselves refuse:
#         'could not look' is not 'nothing wrong'. A caller that genuinely
#         accepts missing fixtures can treat 3 as success; the release
#         checklist must not.

# FULL PER-GATE LOGS + MACHINE STATE (GitHub issue #3). `cross_tool` once failed in a
# release sweep and never reproduced; this runner kept only a short tail of its output and
# nothing recorded memory or load, so the failure left nothing to read. Every attempted
# gate's whole stdout+stderr now goes to <logdir>/<gate>.log, and <logdir>/system.txt gets
# free memory and load at the start and at each failure. X4_GATE_LOG_DIR overrides the
# default (a fresh temp dir); it is refused inside the game or reference tree.
#
# WHICH game/reference: the ones the TOOLS resolve -- environment, then the path config --
# asked of x4validate._paths, never only the exported variables (v4.0.0 review R4-7/R6-10:
# a root named only in x4-paths.env was not seen). The containment test is Python's too:
# `realpath -m` does not exist on macOS, where the old check failed OPEN. A resolver that
# cannot run REFUSES: a log dir that cannot be checked is not a log dir that passed.
