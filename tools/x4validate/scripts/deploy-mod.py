"""Deploy a mod this toolkit SHIPS into the game's extensions folder -- guarded, dry-run
first, no recursive delete.

    uv run python scripts/deploy-mod.py <mod> [<mod> ...]            # DRY RUN, writes nothing
    uv run python scripts/deploy-mod.py <mod> [<mod> ...] --apply    # writes

Run from `tools/x4validate`. The source is always this repo's `mods/<mod>`; the destination
is the game-root extensions folder from your toolkit config (`X4_EXTENSIONS`, or
`X4_GAME/extensions`).

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The obvious form -- `rm -rf "$EXT/$m" && cp -r "$SRC/$m" "$EXT/"` -- is one empty
    shell variable away from deleting the wrong tree inside the game installation, and it
    destroys the destination BEFORE the copy, so a failure part way leaves no mod at all.
    This script never removes a directory. It diffs the two trees, copies what is new or
    changed, and unlinks orphans one named file at a time after printing them.

GUARDS, in order. Any failure raises `Refused` before a single byte is written, and with
several mods EVERY mod's guards run before ANY mod is written:
    1. the mod is one this repo SHIPS: a folder under `mods/` carrying a content.xml
    2. the extensions root is configured and EXISTS -- a typo must not create a folder the
       game never reads
    3. it is not inside the user PROFILE: neither inside the configured one, nor on ANY
       path shaped like `Egosoft/X4/<digits>/...` (an unconfigured X4_PROFILE is
       announced). Dependencies resolve only within one extensions root, so a profile
       deploy reads every dependency as MISSING
    4. its parent looks like a GAME ROOT (it carries 01.cat)
    5. both manifests are well-formed; the source has an id; if the destination exists,
       its manifest id EQUALS the source's. Folder name is not identity
    6. LINKS: the destination folder is not itself a link or junction; no file is written
       through a link, or to a path resolving outside the destination; every orphan
       scheduled for deletion is a plain file (not a link) under the destination

AFTERWARDS it re-reads the destination and requires the same file SET with every file
byte-identical by sha256. A deploy that reports success without re-reading is a claim.

A DEPLOYED FILE IS NOT A LOADED FILE. X4 keeps running the lua it read at load; after
deploying the helper, restart the game and check `x4live query probe` reports the new
`build=`.

Exit: 0 every deploy verified - 1 a deploy did not verify, or failed part way - 2 refused
or not configured.
