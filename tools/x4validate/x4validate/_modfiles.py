"""Which XML documents a mod (or the overlay set) supplies -- the ENUMERATION half of a build.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (AUDIT-2026-09-24 FR-2). Two functions that decide which documents
the effective store and BaseX `x4eff` contain lived where the engine freshness axis could
not watch them:

* `mod_xml_paths` was `_compat._mod_xml_paths`. `_effective.build_touch_map` calls it to
  decide which vpaths each mod touches -- which is provenance in the store -- but `_compat`
  carries the x4compat CLI, and F69 (`tests/test_engine_sources_carry_no_cli.py`) keeps CLI
  modules out of `_freshness.ENGINE_SOURCES`, because a help-text edit would otherwise mark
  every artifact stale for nothing.
* `overlay_vpaths` was `all_vpaths` in `tools/basex/build-effective.py`, outside the package,
  where no engine hash could see it at all.

An edit to either changes a built artifact for byte-identical inputs, which is exactly what
the engine axis exists to detect. The remedy is F69's own: make the POPULATION right -- lift
them into a module with no CLI and name that module. `_compat._mod_xml_paths` is kept as an
alias, so every existing caller is unchanged.

This module imports no argparse, defines no entry point and prints nothing.

    contested = shipped by at least one overlay (so a merge is required)
    untouched = base/DLC only (the base file already IS the effective file)

    The base set comes from `_effective.base_vpaths`, NOT a local `reference.rglob`: the
    rglob form is loose-only and cannot see packed DLC -- MEASURED 2026-08-22, that cost the
    index 119 of 142 mini-DLC documents (BLIND-SPOTS F34).

    An overlay whose catalog cannot be read used to contribute NOTHING with no record (a
    bare `except: pass`). It still contributes its loose files, and the failure is now
    appended to *failures* -- the build reports it -- because a narrowing step must say so
    (AUDIT-2026-09-24 BX-6).

    Behaviour is otherwise byte-for-byte what `build-effective.py` did, including counting
    each overlay's own `content.xml` as contested; changing what x4eff indexes is not what
    moving this function is for.
