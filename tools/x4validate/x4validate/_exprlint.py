r"""Heuristic linter for X4 *script-expression* breakages the XSD can't see.

The bundled `md.xsd`/`aiscripts.xsd` validate XML *structure* — element/attribute
shape — but treat every attribute VALUE as an opaque `xs:string`. X4's script
mini-language lives inside those values (`exact="$list.random"`,
`text="'%s'.[$a]"`, `in="[a, b]"`), so a broken expression sails through schema
validation and only fails when the *engine* parses it at load (-> debug.txt).

This module is the pattern-detectable half of that gap (the authoritative half is
the `--debug` debug.txt correlation): a small, measured rule set over attribute
values, seeded from KNOWLEDGEBASE.md "Version Migration Map". It is ADVISORY by
design (findings are `warn`/`info`, never gating) — a regex heuristic should flag
for review, not fail a build. Every rule below was measured against vanilla 9.0
`reference\` at ~0 false positives before being added. Grows as we learn; a rule
that proves noisy (e.g. the dropped `{a.b, c.d}` catch, which fires on valid
`.{[list]}` accessors in md/) is removed, not shipped.
