    overlay — is built only when a name misses, which measured 7 distinct names
    across ~5 mods. A clean mod therefore never pays for it.

    That corpus half costs **~13s** (13,579 files) and is what takes a VRO

    The price buys 4 false positives removed corpus-wide, and `check_references`
    prints `(+ corpus scan)` so the cost is announced rather than hidden.

    Behaves as a set for the only two operations `_refs` performs on it

    *adds* those wares and loads AFTER `cpsdo_faction`, which patches them — neither
    declares a dependency on the other, so the engine runs the patch first and skips
    it. A real upstream bug our optimistic tree was hiding.

    **The two trees ARE now split (2026-07-28).** The limitation this docstring used
    to describe as theoretical was confirmed against the engine, so reference /
    file-existence / connection checks run on `TierB.final` while `sel=` resolution
    keeps this patch-time tree. `X4CapturableXenonXL` (load position 79) proves both
    directions at once, which is why one tree cannot serve both:

      - patch-time is RIGHT for `sel=`: its three `<remove sel="…connection_cockpit">`
        ops match the vanilla node at position 79. Against the final tree they read as
        'sel matched nothing' — 3 false alarms — because `xspvro` (position 92)
        replaces that macro file wholesale.
      - final is RIGHT for references: `xspvro` re-points `ship_xen_xl_carrier_01_a_macro`
        at component `ship_pla_xl_battleship`, which has 243 connections and lacks
        `connection_shieldgen_external03` (vanilla `ship_xen_xl_carrier_01` HAS it).
        The mod's `libraries/loadouts.xml:44` still asks for it, so at runtime the
        loadout is broken — a REAL defect the patch-time tree cannot see, and which
        the deployed copy therefore reported as 0 errors.

    Not engine-logged: a loadout mismatch only surfaces when the ship is instantiated,
    and the reference log is a load-time capture. The chain is verified statically
    instead (load order 79 < 92; both mods ship the macro file, so the later wins).

    The mod under test is excluded by BOTH folder name and content.xml id, since
    a dev folder is usually also deployed under extensions\\ and would otherwise
    be merged in twice (its own ops pre-applied, masking real misses).

    Load order here is the community-reported convention (alphabetical,
    dependencies first) — advisory, not engine-verified.

    """(severity, category, message) for a <diff> the engine never loads at all.

    A patch aimed at ANOTHER MOD's file must live at `extensions/<owner>/<rel>` inside
    your mod. At the BARE mirrored path it is inert: the engine only consults
    reference/ + DLC for that path, finds the file is not base-game content, and never
    opens the file. Nothing is logged, no op is rejected, and the mod loads clean — the
    quietest failure in X4 modding.

    Proven 2026-08-01 from a two-run debug.txt, on ONE identical rel path under
    `assets/units/size_s/macros/`, with three mods involved: the file's OWNER is
    logged; a second mod's NESTED patch (`extensions/<owner>/<rel>`) of it is logged
    AND has its op evaluated (`[=ERROR=] No matching node ... @makerrace`); a third
    mod's BARE-path patch of the same path is absent from both runs — even though
    that mod is loaded, its own base-game-path files being logged three times.
    Same path, same load, three mods, two logged and one not.

    Why this needs its own finding rather than falling out of the existing
    `_no_base_finding`: under Tier B an installed mod's full file satisfies `base_found`
    (`_merge.build_effective`'s `base_found or mode in {union, full}`), so `merged.tree`
    is non-None and the Tier A error is silently CURED by installing more mods. Measured
    on the live 101-mod install: Tier A reports these 7 files, Tier B reports 0 errors and
    exits 0 — a false OK, in the tier the convention tells you to use for cross-mod work.

    The tool CAN catch those -- MEASURED on the same file, `--update` reports the

    advisory. What it does not do is run any script check by default, and that is
    deliberate: compiling md.xsd costs ~102s, so both `check_xsd` and the fast
    `check_required_attrs` pass sit behind --update.

    So the defect was never a missing check. It was a missing SENTENCE: for a mod
    whose payload is script files, nothing applicable ran, and the run still said
    "OK: no issues found" -- exactly what `Skipped` exists to prevent, and what
    this same tool already refuses to do for a content.xml-only folder.

    ship script XML and 18 are script-only. An exit 3 firing on 18 mods
    permanently, clearable only by paying the ~102s compile every run, converts it
    from "investigate" into "ignore" -- a check that floods is worse than no check.

    TWO populations, reported separately, because the ADVICE differs. Direct
    children of `md/` and `aiscripts/` are fixable by `--update`. A nested
    cross-mod patch is not: both halves of `_xsd.validate_mod` filter
