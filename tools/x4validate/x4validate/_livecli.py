"""`x4live` - ask the RUNNING ENGINE what it saw, and diff it against our model.

Every other tool here reasons about files. This one reports what X4 itself had in
memory: the extension list it built, its error log, and the fully-resolved stats it
computed for a macro. That makes it the only ORACLE in the toolkit - the one thing
that can tell us our merged tree is wrong rather than merely self-consistent.

HOW THE DATA ARRIVES. A read-only lua probe assigns a TSV payload to a lua global
declared as a `<savedvariable>`; the engine serialises it into `{profile}/uidata.xml`
on exit. `_livedump` decodes and self-checks it. See that module for the three
escaping layers and for why a mid-session read is a NON-ANSWER rather than a zero.

TWO RULES THIS CLI EXISTS TO KEEP, both learned expensively elsewhere:

  * **Compare PER ITEM, never totals.** The first real run of this channel produced
    132 extensions from the engine and 132 from our model - and the MEMBERSHIP was
    wrong on both sides, two errors cancelling. A matching total is the shape a real
    divergence hides in (CLAUDE.md 1b).
  * **`GetExtensionList()` is an installed INVENTORY with an `enabled` flag, NOT the
    load set.** Comparing it to `mods("active")` without saying which scope you mean
    is the same category error as reading `Collision.winner` as an owner (#18). The
    scope is therefore explicit and printed in the output.

A dump that is missing, stale or malformed exits 2 or 3 and never 0: "I could not
ask" must not look like "there is no disagreement".

THE WRITE HALF. Exactly two verbs change the running game, `pause` and `unpause`, and
each has its own subcommand (`WRITE_VERBS`). They take no arguments, print a banner on
stderr before sending, and exit 0 only when the engine's own read-back agrees with what
was asked. `unpause` undoes only a pause this channel made. `pausestate` is their READ
half, and the only safe next step when a write's reply is lost: the command is sent
before the reply is read and is never resent, so a lost reply is not a lost write.
`query` refuses the write verbs by name, so its free-text passthrough cannot become a
second, bannerless door to them.

#: back in RADIANS/sec where the store holds the XML value in DEGREES/sec --
#: 3.8397243022919 rad = 220.0000 deg = `thrust.pitch`, roll 4.1887903213501 =
#: 240.0000, yaw likewise. Three axes, exact to four decimals. Corroborated on
#: the store side: across 47 macros `thrust.pitch` ranges 0..2651, which is
#: degrees-shaped -- as radians, 2651 would be 422 rotations per second.
#:
#: Without this the oracle reports THREE false disagreements on every thruster in
#: the game, and a check that cries wolf is one you stop reading.
_TRANSFORMS = {
    "identity": lambda v: v,
    "degrees": lambda v: v * 180.0 / 3.141592653589793,
}

#: Transforms that need the ENTITY, not just the value. A value-only lambda cannot
#: reach a sibling property, and one mapping needs exactly that: the engine reports a
#: missile's explosiondamage for the whole SALVO while the store holds the per-missile
#: warhead. MEASURED 2026-09-20 on `missile_gen_s_swarm_01_mk1_macro`: engine 1680,
#: store explosiondamage.value 210, missile.amount 8 -- 8 x 210. The other four
#: missiles in the fixture carry amount=1, which is why an identity mapping looked
#: clean and shipped a FALSE disagreement against our own store. `_dps_channels`
#: already multiplies by `bullet.amount` for the same reason.
_CONTEXT_TRANSFORMS = {
    "per_salvo": lambda v, props: v / (_num(props, "missile.amount", 1.0) or 1.0),
}

#: THE MAP IS KEYED BY LIBRARY TYPE, because a field NAME does not determine its
#: meaning. `shield` on a shieldgentypes entry is that generator's own capacity
#: (`recharge.max` = 2287); `shield` on a shiptypes_* entry is the ship's TOTAL
#: shielding, which the engine derives through `libraries/loadouts.xml` and our
#: store does not model at all. Same for `hull`: `hull.max` on a ship (2500), but
#: on an engine/shield/thruster the engine answers a flat 1000 matching no stored
#: property. A flat field->prop map silently applies one meaning to the other --
#: the `Collision.winner` category error (CLAUDE.md #18) inside a lookup table.
#:
#: EVERY entry is VERIFIED against a real dump on a NON-DEGENERATE value (never 0
#: or 1, which match anything); the confirming value is in the comment. Do not add
#: a speculative one: a guessed mapping sits in the same slot, in the same grammar,
#: as a measured one, and reports a DISAGREEMENT against our own store as though
#: the MODEL were wrong. Use `x4live mappings` to propose, never to auto-apply.
#:
#: THE TRANSFORM IS DECLARED, NEVER INFERRED AT COMPARISON TIME. Picking whichever
#: transform makes the values agree would produce a check that CANNOT FAIL -- the
#: exact shape CLAUDE.md #26 exists to refuse.

#: Hull-carrying mobile objects; `satellites` shares the ship field vocabulary.

# MEASURED 2026-09-20 against a live `groundtruth --contents` harvest of 45 weapon macros:
# 39 resolvable (6 are decorative `*_video_macro` with no `bullet.class`), and 38 of those
# reproduce the engine's `dps` and every per-channel `*dps` EXACTLY at 1e-6 relative.
# Beam 15/15 · continuous 9/9 · clip 14/15 · `reloadrate` 39/39.
#
# ⚠ WHY THIS WAS BELIEVED IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL NOW. `dps` sat in `_DERIVED` under
# "we do NOT reimplement X4's maths", on the finding that it was weapon-type-dependent
# across six variants. That was THREE MISSING INPUTS, not three physics:
#   * `reload.time` is the RECIPROCAL SPELLING of `reload.rate`. MEASURED over the whole
#     corpus: of 299 bullet macros, 174 carry `reload.rate`, 119 carry `reload.time`, 0
#     carry both, 6 carry neither. Reading only `reload.rate` silently drops 40% of bullets.
#   * `bullet.chargetime` (> 0) is part of the firing PERIOD.
#   * area damage folds into the SAME channel as its direct damage, not a separate one.
# With all three it is one formula whose only branch is beam-vs-not.
#
# ⚠ AND THE BRANCH MUST NOT READ THE ENGINE. The obvious discriminator is the engine's
# `isbeamweapon`, and using it here would be CIRCULAR: `_DERIVE` feeds the oracle that
# compares our value AGAINST the engine, so a model taking an engine input proves nothing
# about the store. MEASURED 2026-09-20: the store's `bullet.attach` agrees with
# `isbeamweapon` on 39 of 39 (24 at 0, 15 at 1). That is the discriminator used below.

    IDENTICAL data over the live pipe, as a TSV whose columns are literally
    `librarytype / macro / field / engine_value`. Nobody ever connected the two, so the

    exactly where a merge error hides *without any single attribute being wrong* --
    so the engine's answers are the fixture any future traversal must reproduce.

    Those answers previously came from a uidata dump, and one was LOST to a game
    restart, which stalled the work. This gets them over the live pipe instead: no
    probe mod, no `uidata.xml`, nothing the game can overwrite -- and it writes them
    to `dev/_reports/` immediately, in the same breath.

    ⚠ IT RECORDS, IT DOES NOT COMPARE. Several of these fields have MORE THAN ONE
    defensible definition and nothing offline distinguishes them. On
    `ship_arg_xl_carrier_01_a_macro`, `docks_s` could be 8 (dockingbays reached
    through one dockarea), 18 (plus 10 launch tubes, which carry `dock.allow=0`), or
    78 (plus a 70-berth ship storage). Writing a traversal now would be picking one
    of those and calling it modelled. The harvest is what turns that guess into a
    lookup.

#: Every distinct field literal vanilla passes to `GetComponentData`, MEASURED
#: 2026-08-30 over 887 call-site lines in `ui/addons`: **182 names**. The mod itself
#: reads 16 of them.
#:
#: WHY THIS LIST EXISTS AT ALL. `GetComponentData` accepts ARBITRARY names, so the
#: engine's real vocabulary is unbounded and unknowable from outside. That makes an
#: absent answer ambiguous in the worst way: "the engine has no such field" and "nobody
#: ever asked" look identical. Vanilla's own usage is the one denominator available, and
#: it is a real one -- these are names the engine demonstrably answers for SOMETHING.
#:
#: Cross-checked on extraction: all 16 fields the mod already reads appear in this set.
#: An extraction that could not reproduce a total it did not choose is a rumour.
