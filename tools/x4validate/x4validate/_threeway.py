"""Three-way diff: which changes are the AUTHOR's, and which are upstream drift?

A two-way diff between an archived mod and the current tree answers the wrong
question, and it answers it confidently. MEASURED by a parallel session over a
real 2021 mod, 135 documents: **~440 attribute deltas two-way, 15 author edits
three-way**, 340 upstream drift, and **124 of 135 documents byte-verbatim copies
of the baseline**. Acting on the two-way figure would have re-applied 340 of the
upstream author's changes as if they were the user's, and reverted the current
upstream release across 124 files.

The mechanism is a join, not a new differ. Two ordinary two-way diffs share a
common ancestor, so their attribute changes can be keyed on
``(vpath, node-path, attr)`` and compared::

    D1 = diff(base -> archived)   what the AUTHOR did
    D2 = diff(base -> current)    what UPSTREAM did since

    in D1 only ................. author-edit
    in D2 only ................. upstream-drift
    in both, same new value .... converged
    in both, different values .. BOTH-MOVED   <- the only real decision

Reusing `_diff` rather than re-implementing it is deliberate: a second
implementation of the same normalisation is what made an independent measurement
of F64 report 2.6% where the truth was 65.4%.

⚠ **A one-sided absence is UNKNOWN, never a removal.** This is the rule the
workspace paid for: 16 macros appeared to have lost ``missile.targetable`` when
upstream had simply added it after 2021. A three-way diff *can* tell those apart
-- that is its whole purpose -- but only where the baseline actually contains the
document. Where it does not, the document goes to :attr:`ThreeWay.no_base` and is
excluded from every verdict, counted rather than quietly dropped.
