"""Resolve X4's macro/component/connection graph to real files on disk.

Powers two v1.1 checks:
  - file-existence: <component ref="X_macro"> -> index/macros.xml value -> macro
    file exists? -> macro's <component ref> -> index/components.xml -> file exists?
  - connection-validation: a <loadout> entry `path="../con_engine_01"` must match a
    <connection name="con_engine_01"> in the ship's component.

Index `value` is a path WITHOUT `.xml`, backslash-separated, relative to the
SOURCE ROOT that defined the entry (base/DLC entries -> reference root, since DLC
values carry the `extensions\\ego_dlc_x\\` prefix; mod entries -> the mod root).
Mods conventionally write values game-root-relative too (`extensions\\<mod>\\assets\\...`,
matching the engine), so for mod entries that leading `extensions\\<mod>\\` is stripped
before resolving against the mod root (else the path doubles -> spurious 'file missing').
Wildcard entries (`character_*`) are skipped — they're patterns, not files.
