r"""Read X4 ``.cat``/``.dat`` mod archives as an in-memory virtual filesystem.

X4 mods ship either loose files or packed catalog pairs. To reason about a packed
mod (e.g. VRO, which is 217 MB packed and otherwise invisible to our tooling) we
must read its catalog directly. The format is simple and community-documented:

- A ``.cat`` is a UTF-8 text index, one line per member::

      <virtual/path> <size> <unix_mtime> <md5hex>

  Paths may contain spaces; the trailing three tokens are fixed, so we parse from
  the right (``rsplit(" ", 3)``).
- The matching ``.dat`` stores member payloads concatenated in ``.cat`` line order,
  so a member's byte offset is the running sum of preceding sizes.
- A mod folder may hold ``ext_NN.cat`` (extension-local additions/diffs) and/or
  ``subst_NN.cat`` (full-file base-game substitutions). Both are read and resolve by
  virtual path; later catalogs override earlier ones for the same path.
- ``*_sig.cat`` are signatures — skipped.
- Version/diff catalogs (``ext_vNNN.cat``, ``ext_NN_diff_vNNN.cat``) load ONLY when
  the game version equals NNN exactly (Egosoft workshop guide; engine-proven
  2026-08-02 via two independent debug.txt fingerprints). Mods DO ship them — a
  stale one is dead weight the engine ignores too, so skipping matches the engine
  for every non-matching version. A cat matching the CURRENT game version would be
  live; those are still skipped here, with a warning, until support is built.

This is an independent implementation from the documented format; cross-checked for
correctness against Egosoft's XRCatTool and meethune/x4cat (MIT) as format references.
