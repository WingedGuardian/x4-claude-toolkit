r"""Ask the RUNNING engine a question, over a Windows named pipe.

THE COMPLEMENT TO `_livedump`. That module reads `{profile}/uidata.xml`, which the
engine truncates to 61 bytes while the game is running and writes back only on exit
-- an OFFLINE BULK oracle. This one is the LIVE SPOT CHECK: a fixed vocabulary asked
of the engine mid-session. They are complements, not alternatives.

THE TRANSPORT, AND WHY WE ARE THE SERVER. `sn_mod_support_apis` ships a lua pipe API
whose `ui/named_pipes/pipes.lua` opens a CLIENT handle to `\\.\pipe\<name>`. It does
not care who created that pipe, so `Pipe_Server_Host` / `Register_Module` /
`permissions.json` -- which exist only so a mod can ship a python file the HOST
auto-launches -- are not needed. We create the pipe; the game connects to it. That
makes the game-side mod four files and zero MD (content.xml, ui.xml, and the two
lua under ui/).

READ `pipes.lua:127`: `Schedule_Read(pipe_name, callback, continuous_read)`. With
`continuous_read` true the callback stays armed (`pipes.lua:513-515` declines to pop
the FIFO entry), so the SERVER PUSHES and the game never polls. `md/hotkey_api.xml`
runs exactly this shape in production.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    THE HAZARD THIS MODULE EXISTS TO REFUSE
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    `pipes.lua:698`, verbatim:

        If the message is larger than the lua side buffer, returns partial
        data and error ERROR_MORE_DATA.  TODO: look into this.

    CORRECTED 2026-08-29 by reading the PACKED `pipes.lua` (it ships in a .cat,
    not loose; extracted from `ext_01.dat` at offset 400716, length 33966). The
    TODO is unhandled, but until today this docstring described the consequence
    wrongly in TWO ways, and both corrections matter:

      * DIRECTION. That comment sits on `_Read_Pipe_Raw` -- the game reading OUR
        COMMAND. It says nothing about our replies.
      * OUTCOME. It is NOT silent truncation. `winpipe` exposes only
        ERROR_IO_PENDING and ERROR_NO_DATA (`strings` on the DLL), so there is no
        constant to compare against and ERROR_MORE_DATA (234) falls through to
        `pipes.lua:720` `error(...)`. That is caught by `Read_Pipe`'s pcall,
        reaches `Poll_For_Reads:560` -> `Close_Pipe`, and ERRORs every pending
        read AND write while destroying the pipe. The partial data is discarded.

    The REPLY direction fails the same way, by the api's own documentation:
    "If the write buffer to the server fills up ... or the new message is larger
    than the entire buffer, the pipe will be treated as bad and closed."

    So an over-long message in EITHER direction is a loud, total pipe teardown --
    never a quiet short answer. That is the safer failure (a torn pipe cannot be
    mistaken for data), but it inverts the mitigation: SIZE MUST BE BOUNDED
    BEFORE SENDING, not detected afterwards. Any verb whose result set is
    unbounded caps itself and reports `shown=N of M`.

    The ceiling is still not fully known: python buffers 1 MiB (`_BUF`, raised from
    ramp MEASURED every size up to 64,000 bytes round-tripping intact on
    2026-08-29 -- which refuted an earlier untraceable 2047-byte figure. The true
    ceiling lies above our own buffer and cannot be probed without raising it.
    See BLIND-SPOTS F74.

    Every reply still carries its own BYTE LENGTH and a checksum computed
    game-side over the payload, so a short read fails clause 7 by construction.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE FOUR OUTCOMES, matching `_livedump` so the two oracles ladder identically:

  | outcome                                   | meaning                    | exit |
  |-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------|
  | not Windows / no pywin32 / never connects  | cannot ask                 | 2    |
  | connects, then silence                     | loaded, not executing      | 2    |
  | reply malformed, short, or mis-sequenced   | a NON-ANSWER               | 3    |
  | reply self-checks                          | a real answer, even ABSENT | 0/1  |

Note the third row. `ERROR`, `TIMEOUT` and `CANCELLED` are reserved sentinels in the
lua api's DATA channel, so a naive reader cannot tell them from a payload that
happens to equal one. Ours can: every real reply is a 7-field frame led by `MR`, and
a bare sentinel has no tabs at all.

Never collapse "not loaded" into "not answering". The Skyrim VR session shipped a
liveness probe that was wrong for three releases because it hung in exactly the case
it existed to detect.

#: in a game crash the same session (minidump: a NULL-pointer dereference inside X4's
#: own UI event-dispatch code, reached through `lua_pcall`, NOT in the pipe DLL or lua
#: runtime). The teardown floor is therefore in (1997, 3998]; this stays safely below
#: it. `ask()` is the ONE place a request is written, so enforcing here means no client
#: path -- a query passthrough, ffi-census, the ramp -- can breach it.
MAX_REQUEST_BYTES = 1900


#: Appended to a "nothing connected" refusal ONLY when the window state could not be
#: measured. A future session reading one of these must be able to tell a RETRYABLE state
#: from a broken one -- shrugging at a minimized game and reporting "failed" is exactly the
#: outcome this text prevents.
#:
#: ⚠ THIS USED TO BE A 1,798-CHARACTER ESSAY appended to EVERY refusal, because nothing
#: could measure which cause applied and it hedged across all of them. `game_is_minimized`
#: now measures the main one, so the essay is replaced by a one-line diagnosis where the
#: answer is known and by this short residue where it is not. It also shed two things that
#: had stopped being its job: "grep debug.txt for the load marker" (read for the user by
#: `helper_loaded_this_session`) and "the mod is probably not installed" (measured directly
#: by `helper_is_deployed`, which names the extension and its dependency in its own branch).
#:
#: THE FULL PROVENANCE of the three claims below, kept here rather than in user output
#: because two measurements of different ages must not be flattened -- collapsing them is
#: what made the pre-2026-08-31 advice ("X4 STOPS EXECUTING WHEN IT IS NOT IN THE
#: FOREGROUND") wrong:
#:   * UNFOCUSED IS FINE -- 2026-08-30, sampling the engine's own getElapsedTime() over a
#:     30 s wall window: windowed unfocused 32.98 s engine / 32.98 s wall, windowed focused
#:     32.24 / 32.24, a ratio of 1.00 in BOTH. A 370-query harvest completed unfocused.
#:   * MINIMIZED STOPS IT -- originally one figure from exclusive fullscreen only (574.76 s
#:     of engine time across 70.4 min of wall clock, 13.6%, and zero bytes to debug.txt for
#:     5.5 min), which never separated minimized from merely unfocused and is how the old
#:     generalisation arose. MEASURED 2026-09-20 in BOTH display modes and now direct:
#:     windowed-minimized 0.031 CPU core-s/s and fullscreen-alt-tabbed 0.016, against
#:     0.81-25.9 while active. So the rule is MINIMIZED, in either mode -- not "background".
#:   * A PAUSED GAME IS NOT A CAUSE -- MEASURED 2026-09-13, a paused game kept answering on
#:     an open connection and accepted a new one. The earlier "a PAUSED game goes silent"
#:     was INFERRED from the api's MD heartbeat firing only on unpaused frames, and is
#:     WITHDRAWN: the UI `onUpdate` half of the frame detector keeps polling regardless.
#: MECHANISM, read from source: the pipe is polled by `Poll_For_Reads` via
#: `Time.Register_NewFrame_Callback`, driven by `SetScript("onUpdate", ...)`.
