"""Nexus + Steam API clients. API-FIRST: all Nexus access is via the API, NEVER scraped.

- Nexus metadata by id : v1 REST   /v1/games/x4foundations/mods/{id}.json   (apikey header)
- Nexus name -> id     : v2 GraphQL /v2/graphql  (nameStemmed filter, gameId 2659)
- Steam ws_ title      : keyless ISteamRemoteStorage/GetPublishedFileDetails

OPERATING NOTES (were resident in CLAUDE.md until 2026-09-20; they belong with the code).

- `status` on the v1 payload is `published` / `removed` / `hidden`; the last two mean the
  mod is unavailable, which is a finding about the mod, not an error to swallow.
- Folder ids rarely match mod names. Humanize (split camelCase and underscores) and DROP a
  leading author token when the first search comes back empty.
- Rate budget ~20k/day and ~2k/hour; `X-RL-Daily-Remaining` carries what is left.
- A key is per-user and free: nexusmods.com -> Site preferences -> API Access -> Personal
  API Key. The AUP makes it PERSONAL: a public tool must have each user supply their own,
  so never bundle, commit or log one.
- Identity/version resolution is LOCAL-FIRST, cheapest first: the installed `content.xml`,
  then the mod folder README/changelog, then the Steam Workshop page, and the Nexus API
  last -- it is the only source for what upstream currently ships.
- The same host serves every game: the endpoints take a game_domain_name and a mod_id, so the
  SHAPE ports to another Nexus-modded game -- but this module does not, unchanged: the domain
  is baked into NEXUS_REST and the numeric game id into X4_GAMEID.
