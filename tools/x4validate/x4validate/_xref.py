r"""x4xref: a cross-index of MD / aiscript actions, events, and cue edges.

Behavioral mod interactions (two mods reacting to the same event, one disabling an
engine feature another relies on) are invisible to a file/node collision check and
painful to trace by grep: the decisive tokens often share no keywords with the
concept (ATD suppresses ejection via ``set_emergency_eject_active`` +
``set_object_min_hull`` — neither contains "eject" or "death"). This index answers
the three questions that actually matter for interaction analysis in one lookup:

- ``who-calls <action>``  — every place an MD/aiscript action element appears,
  cue-edge actions (``signal_cue``, ``cancel_cue``, ...) included
- ``who-listens <event>`` — every cue whose condition fires on an ``event_*``
- ``cue <name>``          — where a cue is defined, signalled, and cancelled

built over base + DLC + every installed mod (packed or loose). Structural containers,
control flow (``do_if``/``do_else``/``do_elseif``/``do_all``/``do_while``/``do_for_each``
and the generic ``check_all``/``check_any``/``check_value``/``check_age``), and
variable/debug plumbing are excluded so the index stays about behavior, not
bookkeeping -- the exact list is ``_SKIP_TAGS``. A SPECIFIC condition such as
``check_object`` names what it tests, so it IS indexed, as an action.
