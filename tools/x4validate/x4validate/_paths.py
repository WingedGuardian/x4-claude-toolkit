r"""One place that answers "where is the game / profile / reference / registry?".

**The defect this exists to fix (shipped in v2.0).** `install.sh` / `install.ps1`
write `.claude/x4-paths.env` using the names `X4_GAME`, `X4_EXTENSIONS`,
`X4_PROFILE`, `X4_MODS`, `X4_REFERENCE`, `X4_TOOLKIT`. The Python package read a
*different* set — `X4_GAME_EXTENSIONS`, `X4_PROFILE_CONTENT`,
`X4_PROFILE_EXTENSIONS`, `X4_WORKSHOP_CONTENT`, `X4_REGISTRY` — and **the overlap
was exactly one name, `X4_REFERENCE`.** Nothing bridged them: `x4-paths.env` is read
by `.claude/hooks/_x4-env.sh` and `bin/`, never by Python. So a user on the
`separate` or `global` install layout ran the installer, saw it succeed, and then had
`--tier b`, `x4compat`, `x4stats`, `x4similar`, `x4xref`, `x4modlist` and
`x4effective` silently fall back to CWD-relative paths. It was invisible on the
development machine only because the hardcoded defaults there happened to be right.

**Resolution order** for every location, first hit wins:

  1. the INSTALLER's env var name (what `x4-paths.env` and the docs use)
  2. the LEGACY env var name (what the Python used to read) — nothing that works
     today may break
  3. the config FILE (the common case, since a plain shell exports none of the
     above), chosen by ONE rule that `_x4-env.sh` mirrors exactly (Plan 3 lane I;
     `tests/test_config_precedence_agrees.py` pins the two together):
     `$X4_CONFIG` (explicit -- naming no file means NO file is read) >
     `<toolkit>/x4-paths.env` > `<toolkit>/.claude/x4-paths.env` (the 3.x location,
     still read for all of 4.x, with a one-line deprecation notice) > none.
     `<toolkit>` is the toolkit this module LIVES IN (B2, install red-team 2026-10-04:
     an inherited `$X4_TOOLKIT` naming another copy made a second toolkit's
     `x4refguard apply` target the first one's reference tree), or `--toolkit` when a
     command was given one (`use_toolkit`). `$X4_TOOLKIT` naming a different directory
     earns one stderr line naming both roots and is otherwise NOT used. Only code living
     outside the `<root>/tools/x4validate/x4validate/` layout falls back to `$X4_TOOLKIT`,
     and only when that is unset too does the search walk up from the CWD, new before
     legacy at each level.
     The bash loader (`_x4-env.sh`, in the DEPLOYED guard copies) still reads
     `$X4_TOOLKIT`: a guard lives in a game root and legitimately reaches a separate
     toolkit through it. The two agree whenever `$X4_TOOLKIT` names the toolkit whose
     tools run -- the installed shape -- which tests/test_config_precedence_agrees.py
     pins.
  4. a derivation from an already-resolved location (`$X4_GAME/extensions`,
     `$X4_PROFILE/content.xml`, ...)
  5. `_LOCAL_FALLBACK` — development-machine defaults, empty in the public tree

The file is PARSED, never sourced: running a shell to read config is an arbitrary
code path we do not need, and it would not work on Windows without a shell anyway.

    `setx X4_TOOLKIT "$TOOLKIT"` -- so the ENV layer answers by DERIVATION while
