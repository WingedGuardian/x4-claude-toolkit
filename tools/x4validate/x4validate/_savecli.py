"""Read an X4 savegame: what is baked into it, and what it references that is gone.

A save is the only artifact the ENGINE wrote. It answers two questions no manifest
can, and both were measured in-game on 2026-08-26 (KNOWLEDGEBASE 2026-08-26k,
CLAUDE.md #33).

WHY THIS IS NOT EXPENSIVE. The scary number is the decompressed size -- the largest
save here is 140 MB compressed and 1.28 GB expanded. That is a wall for a DOM and for
nothing else: streaming the whole thing takes 2.5s, and a scoped attribute sweep over
it 4.2s. Everything here streams; nothing builds a tree.

WHAT <patches> IS, AND IS NOT. It is NOT a record of what loaded. MEASURED: an
extension appears iff its content.xml `save` attribute is ABSENT or `="1"`. Of 129
installed extensions, 11 qualify and 10 were recorded (the gap is ego_dlc_ventures,
an online DLC not loaded as a content patch); of the 118 declaring "0"/"false", zero
appeared. For MODS that is 3 of 121 (2.5%). It is the SAVE-BAKED set -- the ones
unsafe to remove -- and it is *less* complete than the profile content.xml, which is
itself only a decision log. `info` prints the denominator, so the list cannot be
misread as coverage.

WHY `check` IS WORTH HAVING. Removing a mod does not leave dangling references: the
engine SILENTLY DELETES the orphaned content. MEASURED by disabling one mod and
reloading -- its 37 macros / 46 references went to 0, the engine logged ONE error line
(naming a galaxy connection, not the station, ship, production modules or 36 other
macros that vanished), there was no dialog, and the net error count went DOWN by 3
because the mod's own 4 errors left with it. Judged by debug.txt the removal looked
like an improvement. This tool is worth having precisely BECAUSE the engine is quiet:
it names 37 items where the log names one.
  Scope: n=1 mod, one save. `check` reports what a save references that no longer
  resolves; it does NOT assert the general rule.

THREE THINGS THAT MADE THIS WRONG BEFORE IT WAS RIGHT, all enforced below:
  1. `macro=` is NOT always a macro reference. On <connection> it mirrors the
     connection NAME (<connection connection="con_cockpit" macro="con_cockpit">), and
     counting those produced 2,463 false dangling. Only _REF_ELEMENTS carry real ones.
  2. The corpus mixes case and the save lowercases. A case-SENSITIVE compare produced
     1,068 false positives on a stock vanilla save. Folding costs something and the
     cost is REPORTED, never swallowed: 13,308 defined names fold to 12,755, so 553
     (4.2%) collide and a genuine miss could hide behind one.
  3. EntityDefs.__contains__ is a per-NAME oracle whose cost model assumes a mod (7
     misses). A save has 5,022 references; it blew a 600s cap. Use
     EntityDefs.all_names() -- built once, 19.4s. BLIND-SPOTS F65.
