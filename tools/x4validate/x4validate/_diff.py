r"""x4diff: semantic XML diff between two versions of a mod (pristine vs edited).

Isolates a user's personal edits from author content by comparing two mod trees
node/attribute-wise (not textually). Handles packed (cat/dat) and loose on either
side via _merge.overlay_root. Powers the personal-edit recovery: pristine -> edited
= your edit-set; edited -> newer-upstream = what the author has since changed.

Change model per common file: element identity = its tag-path with id/name/ref
disambiguation; report added / removed / changed attributes and added/removed nodes.

Element TEXT is compared too, as the reserved pseudo-attribute ``text()`` (an XML
attribute name cannot contain parentheses, so it can never collide with a real
one). ~48% of installed-mod ops carry their value in text --
``<replace sel=".../@min">999</replace>``, a t-file ``<t id="1">...</t>`` -- and
comparing attributes alone read a 5 -> 999 edit as "changed files: 0"
(AUDIT-2026-09-24 DF-1). Text is compared with every whitespace run collapsed to
one space and the ends stripped, so re-indenting a document -- a multi-line
string included -- changes nothing while any change to the words does. Mixed
content stays POSITIONAL: the text on either side of each child (element or
comment) is its own segment, so moving text across a child is a change. An
element with no non-whitespace text has no `text()` at all.

The top-level ops of a `<diff>` are keyed by what they install (their first
payload child's id/name/macro/ref), else by `sel`; see `_op_key`.
