r"""When was this derived artifact last TRUE — and if it is not, WHAT moved?

Coverage answers *how much* was indexed. Nothing answered *as of when*, so an
artifact that no longer describes the world reported success indefinitely — a
third case beside absence and non-answer: **an answer about a world that has
moved on.**

**The case that produced this module.** BaseX's `x4eff` was built 2026-08-02. The
merge engine was then fixed twice — root-`<replace>` ops were being dropped while
reported applied (2026-08-08, 858 ops, VRO alone 848) and nested cross-mod
patches were invisible from one of two doors (2026-08-11). **Neither date changed
one input file**, so any check watching only inputs would have called the index
fresh. MEASURED after rebuilding: **140 of 194 (72%)** engine thrust rows moved,
and a design decision recorded on 08-02 had quoted VANILLA engine values as if
they were VRO's.

Hence two axes:

``content``  the installed world — every extension's identity, its manifest, and
             the mtime/size of every engine-relevant file it ships, plus a
             reference-tree marker.
``engine``   the CODE that produced the artifact, hashed from source BYTES. A git
             commit does not move for a dirty tree, and merge changes here are
             routinely used before they are committed.

Only artifacts *derived through the merge* are engine-dependent. A raw file index
is not, and flagging it anyway would train the reader to ignore the warning —
which is how a noisy check ends up worse than no check.

One implementation, imported by everyone: `_effective` (the sqlite store),
`_xref` (its TSV index) and `tools/basex/staleness.py` all use this. The
DLC-enumeration bug was written five times precisely because each caller rolled
its own copy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THE CONTENT AXIS COVERS, AND WHY IT WAS WIDENED (2026-08-25)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It used to stat ONLY each folder's ``content.xml``. That made it blind to a mod
whose FILES changed while its manifest did not — which is the ordinary
overlay-deploy workflow: edit ``libraries/god.xml``, copy it in, manifest
untouched.

    MEASURED 2026-08-25: **72 of 121 non-DLC mods (59.5%)** had at least one file
    newer than their own ``content.xml``. Demonstrated directly against the old
    code: a file-only edit returned the IDENTICAL digest ``03122df005f47fbd``
    before and after.

Every artifact therefore reported **FRESH** while describing a different tree.
That is a false FRESH — it fails in the UNSAFE direction, unlike F53's false
STALE, which merely nags.

**Cost of closing it, MEASURED** (`os.walk`, three stable runs; an earlier figure
of 1.73 s was ~92% process-spawn overhead from a bash loop and is logged as
checker-bug #48):

===========================================  =======  =========
variant                                        files       time
===========================================  =======  =========
whole ``extensions\`` tree                    15,523     0.14 s
filtered to .xml/.cat/.dat/.lua                2,042     0.060 s
filtered + per-file triples + tree_sha         2,042     0.092 s
sha256 of all 129 ``content.xml``                129     0.008 s
===========================================  =======  =========

**The suffix filter is CORRECTNESS, not speed.** MEASURED: 8 mods would otherwise
move the fingerprint purely from ``README``/``CHANGES``/``LICENSE``/
``live_editor_log.json`` churn — manufactured staleness, which trains the reader
to ignore the banner, which is how a noisy check ends up worse than none.

**SCOPE LIMIT, stated because a tool that cannot distinguish a guess from a
measurement is a defect.** Per-file identity is ``(relpath, mtime, size)``, NOT a
content hash: hashing every file would mean reading VRO's multi-hundred-MB
``ext_01.cat`` on every CLI run. Consequences, both real:

* an edit that changes NEITHER size NOR mtime is invisible;
* an edit that keeps the size but moves the mtime is classified ``touched``
  rather than ``content``.

Manifests ARE hashed (``manifest_sha``, 8 ms for all 129) because they are small
and because separating *touched* from *actually changed* is exactly what defeated
us in the ``distances`` incident.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THE VECTOR IS PERSISTED (F56)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A digest says THAT the world moved, never WHAT. MEASURED 2026-08-25: localising
one changed mod (``distances``, v160 -> v170) took **nine investigative steps and
three false leads**, and succeeded only because that mod happened to bump its
``version``. A content-identical rewrite with a new mtime would have been
undiagnosable.

So ``content_detail`` computes the per-folder vector and ``hash_content`` folds
it. The vector is persisted beside the digest (149 KB for 121 mods / 2,042
files), which is what lets ``x4modlist changed --files`` name exact files with no
dependency on a possibly-stale BaseX index or on ``_cat``.

``distances`` also rewrote its 26 files **back-dated** two days. A ``max(mtime)``
signal is precisely what back-dating defeats — ``find -newermt`` failed on this
for that reason — so the per-file triples are hashed as a SET, and an mtime
moving BACKWARD registers just as a forward one does.

#: Modules that decide what the EFFECTIVE tree contains. Editing any of them
#: changes the answer for identical inputs.
#:
#: `_effective.py` was ADDED 2026-08-22 after a near-miss. The first five decide
#: what a document MERGES TO; `_effective.py` decides which documents and which
#: entities exist at all (`base_vpaths`, `reference_vpaths`, `macro_vpaths`,
#: `component_vpaths`, `build_touch_map`). An enumeration change moves the store
#: for byte-identical inputs just as surely as a merge change does.
#:
#: The near-miss, stated plainly because it is the only reason this line is
#: right: F34's fix edited `reference_vpaths` itself, and the store's
#: `fingerprint_engine` did not move -- `gates/claims_audit.py` returned 21/21
#: green against a store built by the OLD enumeration. It was correct only
#: because set-equality had been proven by hand (4,002 and 7,551 vpaths, 0
#: added / 0 removed / 0 changed). Nothing in the toolkit would have caught the
#: other outcome, which is exactly the eleven-day `x4eff` failure that produced
#: this contract in the first place.
#: `_registry.py` was ADDED 2026-08-22 alongside `_effective.py`, for the same
#: reason one step further out: it decides WHICH MODS EXIST. `_registry.mods()`
#: is now the single definition of "active" (what the engine loads) vs
#: "installed" (what is on disk), and moving a mod between those two worlds
#: changes the effective tree for byte-identical inputs just as surely as a merge
#: change does. MEASURED the day it was written: one installed-but-disabled mod
#: moved x4eff by 10 documents and x4compat by 4 collision rows.
#:
#: NOTE `_freshness.py` is deliberately NOT in this list. It does not decide what
#: the tree contains, so widening the CONTENT axis here does not pretend the
#: merge code changed -- that distinction is the whole of F53's complaint.

                  "_effective.py", "_registry.py", "_loadorder.py")
#: ⚠ THE LOAD-ORDER GAP IS CLOSED (2026-09-06). `compute_load_order` decides which
#: mod wins every collision (CLAUDE.md gotcha #13: the same macro reads 0
#: alphabetically and 200 in true load order), so editing it changes the merged
#: answer for byte-identical inputs -- precisely what this axis is for. It could not
#: be watched while it lived in `_compat.py`, which also carries the `x4compat` CLI:
#: F69 (`tests/test_engine_sources_carry_no_cli.py`) measured that cost twice, a
#: CLI-text change and a DOCSTRING change each invalidating the effective store and
#: BaseX `x4eff` for rebuilds that could not change one row. That is what trains you
#: to ignore a banner.
#:
#: F69's remedy was 'make the POPULATION right, not the hash clever' -- so the two
#: functions now live in `_loadorder.py`, which imports only `pathlib` and
#: `lxml.etree` and is named above. `_compat` re-exports them, so every caller and

#: still deliberately absent, and still correctly so: it is a CLI module.

    changed a DLC macro, a script, or an index while leaving that one file alone moved
    nothing, so the store could be reported fresh by BOTH axes and still describe a
    world that had changed.

    WHY NOT A FULL WALK. MEASURED on this tree: a stat of every file is 17.6 s, a
    name-only walk 0.80 s, and this survey 0.001 s. The check runs on every query, and
    a check too slow to run protects nothing -- which is why the single marker existed
    in the first place. This is 1,760x cheaper than the full walk and covers all 20
    top-level entries instead of one file.

    WHAT IT SEES: every top-level entry; each directory's CHILD COUNT and the
    sorted names of its direct children; each top-level file's (mtime, size).
    Directory mtimes are deliberately NOT folded -- see the note at the fold. A re-unpack, a
    game patch, an added or removed DLC, or a rename all move it.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE, and this is a LIMIT OF THE APPROACH, not of the effort: an
    in-place edit to an existing file (except the marker below). MEASURED -- changing a
    file's contents moves NO ancestor directory's mtime at any depth, so the only way to
    see it is to stat every file, which is the 17.6 s this exists to avoid.

    ⚠ AND, until 2026-09-05, an ADD or DELETE below depth 2 -- which is not an in-place
    edit and was not covered by that sentence. The survey folded only the top level, so
    `libraries/sub/new.xml` appearing moved nothing, and essentially all reference
    content sits deeper than depth 2. Folding to _SURVEY_DEPTH now covers adds and
    deletes to depth 3; depth 4 and below remain blind, and that is now stated at the
    constant instead of being implied away.

    That is acceptable HERE and nowhere else, for one reason: `reference/` is
    policy-locked read-only behind `.unpacked-and-locked`, so an in-place edit is a
    violation rather than an event. The change that actually happens is a game patch
