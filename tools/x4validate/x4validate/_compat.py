r"""x4compat: detect how the ACTIVE (enabled) mods collide over the effective XML tree.

Unlike a naive file-overlap check (which flags every mod that touches, say,
``t/0001-l007.xml`` — 15 of them, all harmlessly union-merged), this resolves each
mod's intent against the real base+DLC effective tree and dispatches by the engine's
actual merge semantics:

- ``libraries/`` ``index/`` ``t/`` are additively UNIONED by ``@id``/``@name`` — two
  mods co-existing there is normal; only two mods defining the SAME key collide
  (UNION-KEY: later load-order wins).
- Everywhere else, a mod's ``<diff>`` ops resolve to concrete nodes; two mods
  resolving to the same node where at least one replaces/removes it is a HARD
  collision (later wins, the earlier effect is lost or compounded). Two mods only
  ``<add>``-ing under the same parent is SOFT (they coexist).
- Two non-diff full files at the same non-union path FULL-OVERRIDE (later clobbers).

Load order (who wins): the engine's MEASURED order -- case-insensitive folder order,
dependencies loaded in repeated passes (see `_loadorder.compute_load_order` and
`gates/load_order_oracle.py`). Later loads win.

    the extensions dir -- that is the "check this staged update" case. A BARE name

    its mod folders, so `check some_mod` means the copy the game has -- even when a

    Formerly a bare name was tested with `p.exists()` FIRST, so running from inside a
