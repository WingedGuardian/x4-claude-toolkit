r"""One packed-aware, skip-recording walk over a mod's XML.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Six modules each hand-rolled the same loop — rglob the loose tree, parse, then
walk the `.cat` members — and every copy ended the same way::

    except etree.XMLSyntaxError:
        continue

That `continue` is the bug this package has now fixed at three layers
(`Report.skipped`, `coverage.json`, `_input.require_mod_dir`) and it kept
reappearing because the loop kept being rewritten. Patching the six copies
individually guarantees a seventh. So there is one copy, and it takes a channel
for what it could not read.

Measured before the fix: `_check.iter_mod_xml_roots` dropped **12 files across 3
installed mods, 9 of them `<diff>` files** — precisely what `check_sel_resolution`
exists to examine. Neither existing guard caught it: `MergeResult.skipped` is a
different code path (overlay-tree parses), and the `checked == 0` warning only
fires at *zero*, so five good diffs plus one malformed printed nothing at all.

Ordering contract
-----------------
Loose files win over packed catalog members, matching the engine and
`_merge.overlay_root`. A loose file that will not parse still shadows its packed
twin — it is recorded as unreadable rather than silently falling through to the
packed copy, because the engine would not fall through either.
