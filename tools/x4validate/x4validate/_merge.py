"""Reproduce X4's *effective* XML for a virtual path: base + DLC (+ mods).

Per-overlay strategy:
  - root <diff>                         -> apply add/replace/remove ops (pos/if/silent)
  - non-diff under a shared-registry
    dir (libraries/, index/, t/) with

  - any other non-diff root             -> full-file override (asset macro/component files)

The union case matters: every DLC ships libraries/ships.xml, character_macros.xml,
wares.xml, loadouts.xml, ... as full files, and the engine merges their entries with
the base. Treating them as full-file overrides (the old behavior) clobbered base-game
ships/macros out of the effective tree, producing phantom "sel matched nothing" errors
for any mod patching a base entry.
