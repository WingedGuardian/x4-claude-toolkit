r"""x4stats similar-ships: fuzzy same-entity detection across ships.

D2 (`x4compat`) already catches the case where two mods define the SAME registry
key (e.g. two mods both shipping a macro named ``ship_vro_argon_heavy``) — that's a
UNION-KEY collision, unambiguous. This module catches the harder, fuzzier case: two
DIFFERENT ids/macro names that describe essentially the same ship (VRO adds a
rebalanced ship; an unrelated "independent" mod adds a stat-alike ship under its own
name). There is no bright line here — this is advisory, threshold-tuned, and meant to
flag candidates for a human look, not to assert equivalence.

Comparison is scoped HARD by macro ``class`` (ship_xs/s/m/l/xl) and ``purpose.primary``
(fight/trade/mine/...) — an S fighter is never "similar" to an XL destroyer regardless
of how the numbers line up, so cross-class/purpose pairs are never scored.

Ships are scored at their EFFECTIVE values (base + DLC + the enabled mods in load
order, via `_merge.build_effective`), so a `<diff>`-patched ship carries its patched
numbers -- see `_collect_all` (AUDIT-2026-09-24 AN-6). Ships carrying fewer than
`MIN_SHARED_KEYS` scored stats can never be paired and are COUNTED in the output.
