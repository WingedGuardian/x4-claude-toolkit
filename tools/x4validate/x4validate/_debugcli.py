r"""`x4debug` — the engine's own verdict, bucketed, attributed, and compared to ours.

The engine log is the only ground truth we have about what actually happens at
load and at galaxy generation. Until now, reading it was a hand-rolled
`grep | sed | sort | uniq -c` pass, repeated from scratch every session, producing
a table nobody could diff against the last one.

Three things follow from that, and they are the whole design:

**1. The rows must sum to the input.** A hand-rolled table has no way to notice it
dropped a shape — which is exactly how `parse_debug` lost 44% of a log for two
weeks. `triage` prints the residue row unconditionally, including when it is zero,
because a row that appears only when non-zero teaches the reader to read its
absence as "nothing there" rather than "not measured".

**2. Two states are compared PER ITEM, never by their totals.** The 2026-08-13 log
holds 342 failing ops in one cpsdo file; `x4validate --tier b` independently
predicted 310 for that mod. Close enough to look like agreement, and not the same
set. `crosscheck` reports three buckets, and the one that matters most is
`observed-not-predicted`: an op the ENGINE skipped that we never predicted is a
blind spot in the validator, and folding it into a total would hide it.

**3. Subsystem errors name an ENTITY, not a mod.** `[JobEngine] ... JobID: 'x'`
says a job could not spawn; it never says whose job it is. Attribution is
therefore a SEARCH against the effective store, and must be reported as a search —
with its denominator — rather than as a lookup that quietly returns nothing.

What this does NOT do, stated so the scope message can say it: it classifies, it
never fixes, and it never edits a mod. Which buckets are *benign* stays a dated
decision in KNOWLEDGEBASE.md that this tool cites — a suppression compiled into
code outlives the reason for it, and one such line here survived the mod it
referred to being uninstalled.
