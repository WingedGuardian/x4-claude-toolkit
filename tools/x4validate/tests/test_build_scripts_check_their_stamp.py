"""The build scripts must REFUSE when the freshness stamp fails (F126).

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. F126: `build-effective.sh` built the x4eff database correctly, ran
`staleness.py --write` in a subshell whose rc was never captured, and exited 0 on the
coverage verdict alone. The stamp had failed, so a CURRENT database read STALE forever and
refused to back any negative claim. Success reported for work the script did not do.

The fix captures the rc and exits 1. This test is what stops it regressing -- without it
the guard is decoration: nothing could prove it goes red (CLAUDE.md #26).

TWINS, ONE PER SCRIPT. The identical unchecked call sat in BOTH build scripts, and fixing
one would have left the other. So both are asserted here, by name, rather than looping over
a glob that could silently match zero files.

STRUCTURAL, NOT SUBSTRING-ONLY (#37). Prose satisfies substrings -- the comment block
explaining F126 contains the words "stamp" and "exit" and would satisfy a naive search. So
each assertion is anchored to the ACTUAL call: the `staleness.py --write` line must be the
one that captures a return code, and a non-zero one must reach an `exit`.

⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated so the coverage is not overread: it asserts the SHAPE of
the shell source, not the running behaviour. It cannot catch a stamp that succeeds while
writing the wrong fingerprint. The stronger check named in the F126 entry -- compare the
stamped fingerprint against the one the build just computed -- is still unwritten.

    freshness banner itself printed, in two places, plus CLAUDE.md. Anyone copying the
    documented command got half a rebuild and no warning.

    ⚠ THE POPULATION IS THE WHOLE TEST. The first version of this globbed only `*.sh` and
    `*.py` and reported a clean zero -- while the guidance also lives in `README.md`,
    `QUERIES.md` and the shipped repo-root `CLAUDE.md`, none of which it looked at. A
    negative scoped to the wrong population is worth nothing (CLAUDE.md #22, #34), so the
    search set is derived from where the string ACTUALLY appears, not from a habit about
    file extensions, and the count of files searched is asserted so it cannot pass vacuously.

    Two exclusions, both narrow and named: `BLIND-SPOTS.md` documents this very defect and
    must be free to quote the broken form, and `tests/fixtures/` holds a frozen copy of an
