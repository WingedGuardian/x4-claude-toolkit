r"""The mutation probe must not lie, and must not leave the tree poisoned.

TWO THINGS ARE UNDER TEST, and the second is the one that nearly cost a release.

1. VERDICT HONESTY. A mutant that makes the suite HANG is not a pass. Before
   2026-08-26 the probe had no hang verdict at all and a 1800s timeout, so one
   hanging mutant cost half an hour and then reported as a survivor -- two
   different findings collapsed into one word.

2. CRASH SAFETY. Restore lived only in a `finally:`, and `finally` does not run
   on SIGKILL. A killed probe therefore left a MUTATED SOURCE on disk, and that
   file is TRACKED, so `git status` looks like an ordinary modification. v2.5.0
   shipped exactly that way once -- `> 99999` instead of `> 1`, ambiguous-`sel`
   detection silently off in a public release. MEASURED 2026-08-25: a TaskStop
   that reported success but did not stop left three gate sweeps racing, so the
   "never run a mutating gate against a tree in use" rule can be broken BY
   ACCIDENT, not only by choice.
