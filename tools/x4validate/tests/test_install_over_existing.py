"""Installing OVER an existing install -- BOTH installers, the path nothing drove.

The installer had two static test files and neither executes it. That is why a
guaranteed runtime failure was invisible: `install.sh` cannot install over a
toolkit whose config the toolkit own lock has made read-only, and the README
(since aa1c67d) tells users to run that lock.

REPRODUCED 2026-09-07 against a real install, then reduced to the fixture below:

    cp: cannot create regular file '.../.claude/./x4-paths.env': Permission denied

and because the script runs under `set -euo pipefail` and copies SIXTEEN items in
a loop, it died on item 1 leaving `.claude` half-populated, an orphaned
`x4-paths.env.bak-<stamp>` beside it, and nothing printed about what had landed.
`tools` is item 2 -- on a developer machine that is a live tree.

Two properties are pinned here and they are different questions:
  * the install SUCCEEDS over a locked config (it must not need the lock lifted);
  * the config is never touched (byte-identical afterwards, no backup left).

The second is the one that matters. An install that succeeded by overwriting the
users paths would pass the first and be worse than the failure.

    WHY the rule exists: `.gitignore` pinned the two config filenames EXACTLY, so
    the `.bak-<stamp>` files beside them were not ignored at all -- and
    `write_paths_env` carries over every key it does not own (X4_NEXUS_KEY
    explicitly, per setup.sh), so each backup holds the key plus that machine's
    absolute paths, and they show up in `git status` where a `git add -A` would
    take them. PRE-ARC: v3.0.0 already created `.bak-$stamp`. Both directions are
    asserted, because the obvious fix is a blanket `x4-paths.env*` and that
    silently stops tracking the `.example` template the installer ships.

    WHY it is built here rather than run in place. It used to run `git check-ignore` in whatever repo the suite was standing in.
    Two things were wrong with that, and the second is worse:

    * `verify-cold.sh` extracts via `git archive HEAD` into a directory that is
      NOT a git repo, so check-ignore exited 128 and every case read as "not
      ignored" -- six failed and the release gate went red.
    * rc 128 is an ERROR, not a negative answer. Treating any non-zero as "not
      ignored" conflated "git could not look" with "git says no", so the
      `.example` case PASSED IN COLD FOR THE WRONG REASON: it cannot tell
      "correctly not ignored" from "there is no repo here". An error is not an
      allow.

    Building the repo here fixes both, and makes the test assert the file the

# invisible twice over: that leg is continue-on-error, so the RUN still concludes
# success and even `gh run watch --exit-status` returns 0. It was then masked for a
# whole release behind an earlier failing step, and shipped in v3.1.0.
