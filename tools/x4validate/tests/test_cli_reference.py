"""`scripts/gen-cli-reference.py` -- the generated `x4-cli-reference` skill must be FRESH.

The skill is the exact surface of every toolkit CLI, generated from argparse so it
cannot drift from the code. That guarantee is only as good as this test: without it a
new flag lands, nobody regenerates, and the "generated" reference is a hand-kept doc
again with a misleading banner.

Every check here can go red on purpose, and one twin per clause proves it.
