"""C3 (F14 + F12): reference checking beyond `<add>` ops in `<diff>` files.

Both reference checks iterated `iter_diff_files` + `_added_subtrees`, so a mod
shipping FULL files got no reference checking at all -- MEASURED 1,625 full files
across 56 mods, 38% of their XML.

Widening the SCOPE without first fixing the ORACLE would have multiplied two
pre-existing false-positive classes. Measured over all 114 installed mods:

  ware refs   22 unresolved today -> 134 when widened. ALL false: in md/ and
              aiscripts/ the @ware attribute holds a script EXPRESSION
              ($tradeware, ware.energycells), not an id. The forms also appear
              outside those directories (a mod's backups/), so the filter must
              key on the VALUE SHAPE, not the path.
  text refs   45 -> 52. `collect_text_defs` read a hardcoded 2-entry TEXT_FILES
              list, so a mod shipping strings at a non-standard path
              (sfx/weapons/t/0001.xml) had its OWN strings missing from the
              definition set -- 56 of 90 strings for the one mod that does this.

The macro/component oracle is namespace-AGNOSTIC on purpose. `<component ref>`
names a macro inside libraries/wares.xml but a COMPONENT inside a macro file
(gotcha #11), and in a <diff> with `<replace sel="//component">` element
ancestry cannot classify it at all -- only the selector target can. Checking
against the UNION of both namespaces sidesteps every one of those traps and
still yields exactly the 3 genuine dangling refs over 2,300 references.
