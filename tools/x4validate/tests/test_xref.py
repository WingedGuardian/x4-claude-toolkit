# --- the hint path was case-SENSITIVE while the query was not ----------------
#
# `query` matches `r.name.lower() == name.lower()`, teaching the user that case
# does not matter for X4 identifiers -- which is correct, and CLAUDE.md #9 says so
# explicitly, because the corpus genuinely mixes case (`Cluster_104` vs
# `cluster_104`). `_hint_other_kinds` then compared `r.name == name`, so a
# differently-cased argument fell into the "does not appear under ANY kind"
# branch and was printed as "a real negative", with a denominator attached to
# lend it weight.
#
# That inverts the function's whole purpose. Its docstring: "A name that exists
# under another kind is a wrong-command mistake; a name that exists nowhere is a
# real negative. They must never read the same." They read the same, in the
# direction that manufactures a false fact.
#
# REPRODUCED through the shipped CLI over a fully-covered index:
#   who-calls Event_Player_Ejected -> "does not appear under ANY kind - a real negative"
#   who-calls event_player_ejected -> "BUT ... IS in the index under other kind(s)"
#   who-listens EVENT_PLAYER_EJECTED -> 1 occurrence(s)
# The single differing variable is the case of the argument.
