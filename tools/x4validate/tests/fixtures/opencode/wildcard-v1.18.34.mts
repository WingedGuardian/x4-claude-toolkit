// VENDORED, unmodified except as noted, from anomalyco/opencode tag v1.18.34,
// packages/core/src/util/wildcard.ts (last changed in commit 8643c0721eaffb052cf851a5d33d1d721647db5c).
// The ONE change: its first line, `export * as Wildcard from "./wildcard"` (a self re-export that
// needs the package around it), is removed so the file runs standalone under node.
// Used ONLY by tests/test_opencode_config.py to check the toolkit's rendered deny rules against
// OpenCode's own matcher. Not shipped to users' agents. Licence of the vendored code:
