r"""An unconfigured toolkit must REFUSE, never guess — and say so with rc=2.

**The defect this pins (2.5.0).** `_merge.REFERENCE` was::

    REFERENCE = _paths.reference() or Path("reference")

On a machine with nothing configured that resolved to the *relative* path
``reference``, i.e. whatever happens to sit under the current directory. The
consequences ran all the way to the exit code:

  * `_cli.py` passes ``--reference`` with default ``str(_merge.REFERENCE)``, so a
    cold run validated a mod against a tree that does not exist, produced a wall
    of findings about missing base-game files, and returned **rc=1**.
  * rc=1 is also "your mod has real errors". A caller — a script, a CI job, the
    user — could not tell *"your mod is broken"* from *"your toolkit isn't set
    up"*, which are opposite actions.

Commit `ae79fcd` had already named CWD-relative fallback as the defect it was
fixing ("invisible here only because this machine's hardcoded defaults happened
to be right"); this was the last survivor of that family.

**The boundary is deliberate and measured.** The refusal fires when the reference
is *unresolved* (None), NOT when a caller names a tree that happens not to exist:
**12 tests** pass `Config(reference=tmp_path / "does_not_exist")` on purpose —
`test_exprlint.py:80` says so in as many words, "exprlint needs no reference
tree". Making absence-on-disk an error would break honest callers and is a
different question from "you never told me where it is".
