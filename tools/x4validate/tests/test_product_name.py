"""v4.0 renames the product to "X4 AI Assistant Toolkit" (Plan 3 Wave 2, lane K).

Every CURRENT surface -- README, installers, setup, CI, the instruction sources, the release zip --
must carry the new name, and no current surface may still carry an old one. The old names stay
where they are a HISTORICAL fact: release notes, dated plans and measurements, the blind-spots
register, comments that record what a past release shipped, and fixtures that stand for a folder a
user already has. Those are allow-listed below, by CLASS where the class is derivable from the path
and by (path, exact line text) otherwise -- never by line number, which rots on the next edit.

A stale allow-list entry (one that no longer matches any real line) FAILS, so the allow-list
cannot quietly grow into a list of things nobody checks.
