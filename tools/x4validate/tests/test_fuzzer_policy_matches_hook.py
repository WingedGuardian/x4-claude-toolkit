"""The fuzzer's verdict map must cover every rule protect-bash.sh actually has.

It used to be two hand-written tuples and they had drifted. MEASURED 2026-09-01: the
hook maps 19 predicates, the tuples listed 14, so the fuzzer was blind to 5 rules (26%)
and mis-classified a 6th. A seed hitting an unmapped rule reads "already allow" and is
SKIPPED IN SILENCE -- which is how 2 of 12 seeds were dropped from every run, and why a
bypass in those five rules could never have been reported.
