"""Did the helper mod LOAD this session? -- read from a LIVE debug.txt, or refused.

WHY THIS EXISTS. When X4 is running but nothing connects, the refusal could not say WHICH of
two very different things was wrong: the mod is not installed/enabled, or it is loaded and the
frame loop is not executing (minimized). The fix for one is not the fix for the other, and the
hint told the user to go grep debug.txt by hand. This reads that marker for them.

THE SOUNDNESS RULE, and the reason most of these tests are about refusing: debug.txt OUTLIVES
the run that wrote it. A marker in a stale log proves the mod loaded in SOME session, not THIS
one -- so concluding "loaded" from it would be exactly the "a set difference is a QUESTION"
error. Staleness therefore DOMINATES content in both directions: a stale log answers None
whether or not it carries the marker.

Like `game_is_running`, this only ever shapes a MESSAGE. It never decides an outcome, so a
machine whose log is unreadable loses specificity and never gets a different verdict.
