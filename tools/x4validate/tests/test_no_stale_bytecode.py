"""A cached .pyc must not disagree with its source.

WHY THIS EXISTS -- MEASURED 2026-09-12, and it produced WRONG VERDICTS. CPython
invalidates a cached .pyc on (source mtime in SECONDS, source size). A mutation run
that writes a SAME-LENGTH mutant and restores it within the same second leaves the
MUTANT's bytecode in place: the source reads correct, `cmp` says byte-identical, and
the next import silently executes the mutant. Four mutation verdicts were reported
before this was caught, and the only tell was one test failing against code that
had just been proven identical to its backup.

`gates/mutation_probe.py:428` already clears __pycache__ for exactly this reason and
says so in capitals. The defect was reproduced anyway, by hand-rolling a harness
instead of using it. So this is the check that REFUSES -- the only thing that has
ever actually helped, per the register's own conclusion.
