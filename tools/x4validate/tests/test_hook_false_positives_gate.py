"""gates/hook_false_positives.py -- the pure parts of the corpus replay.

The subprocess replay itself takes ~30 minutes and is not tested here. What IS
tested is everything that turned out to be wrong about the first version
(BLIND-SPOTS F82 follow-up, 2026-08-30):

- the artifact carried capped EXAMPLES and no COUNTS, so "1,450" and "25" were
  indistinguishable in the file;
- the measurement OVERWROTE its own baseline, so nothing could be diffed;
- the live hook was REDEPLOYED mid-run and the run reported a number anyway;
- a rule whose reason embeds $COMMAND produced one key per command.
