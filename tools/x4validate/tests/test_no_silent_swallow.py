r"""The guard that makes the bug class extinct instead of merely fixed.

Every false pass this package has shipped had one shape::

    except SomeError:
        continue          # or: pass / return set() / return [] / return None

The caller then cannot tell *found nothing* from *could not look*, and silence
renders as OK. It has now been fixed at four layers (`Report.skipped`,
`coverage.json`, `_input.require_mod_dir`, `_scan.iter_mod_xml`) — and it kept
coming back because six modules each hand-rolled the same loop. Fixing instances
without a guard just schedules the seventh.

So: walk the package AST and fail on any handler whose body only swallows.

**Allowlisting is by inline marker comment, never by file+line.** Line numbers
churn on every edit, so a line-based allowlist rots into a rubber stamp within a
week — and it puts the justification somewhere nobody reads. A marker forces the
reason to live at the code it excuses::

    except (AttributeError, ValueError):
        pass  # silent-ok: console encoding shim, failure means default codec

Prototyped before adoption: 28 sites flagged, ~13 of them legitimate. That ratio
is workable only because the reason travels with the code.
