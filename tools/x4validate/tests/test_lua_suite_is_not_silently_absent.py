"""The Lua contract suite may not go dormant behind a single skip.

`tests/test_modlua_rearm.py` opens with a module-level
`lupa = pytest.importorskip("lupa", ...)`, which is the right call for a machine that
genuinely cannot build it -- but it puts **211 tests** behind ONE skip entry.

MEASURED 2026-09-20 with a 5-test probe: a module-level `importorskip` registers exactly
one entry in `terminalreporter.stats["skipped"]`. `X4_MAX_SKIPS` (68 ubuntu / 56 windows)
therefore absorbs the entire file going dormant, and `ci.yml` deliberately pins no pass
count, so nothing else would notice. Among those 211 are the only tests of the release's
first WRITE verbs -- `pause` / `unpause`, which mutate a running game: ownership,
read-back-vs-intention, advisory wrapping, refusal reasons.

That is the shape `X4_MAX_SKIPS` exists to catch (125 tests dormant behind a green tick),
reached by a route the ceiling cannot see. A lupa import or ABI break -- a Python bump is
the realistic one -- would silence the lot with CI green.

So the absence is asserted HERE, outside that module, where it cannot be skipped away.
Set `X4_ALLOW_NO_LUPA=1` to accept the gap deliberately; then it is a decision with a name
rather than a silence.
