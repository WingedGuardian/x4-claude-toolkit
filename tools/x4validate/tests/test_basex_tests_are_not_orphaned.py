r"""The BaseX tests must actually RUN, not merely exist.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES (MEASURED 2026-08-22). `tools/basex/` ships `test_ask.py` and
`test_staleness.py` — **23 tests that pass** — and `pyproject.toml` sets
`testpaths = ["tests"]`, so the main suite never collected one of them. It
reported "593 passed" and said nothing whatsoever about 23 tests it had not
looked at.

That is this register's founding shape, in the test runner itself: a step that
narrows the population and reports success anyway. And the two files are not
incidental — `ask.py` is what REFUSES to render a zero-result as a finding
without a coverage denominator, and `staleness.py` is the freshness contract.
A silent regression in either would remove a guard while every gate stayed green.

Why a subprocess rather than adding `../basex` to `testpaths`. The original
reason was that BaseX was dev-only and absent from the public bundle; that stopped
being true in v2.6.0, which vendors it. The mechanism stays, for a reason that was
always the stronger one: these tests are cwd-sensitive and manipulate `sys.path`
themselves (`test_staleness.py` inserts its own directory before importing), so
collecting them through a shared `testpaths` would run them from the wrong working
directory. A subprocess with `cwd=BASEX` is what they are written against.

BaseX now ships, so the skip below is a safety net rather than the normal path --
it still fires if someone prunes the optional component. Present → run it;
absent → SKIP with a reason, so "not checked here" can never read as
"checked and fine".
