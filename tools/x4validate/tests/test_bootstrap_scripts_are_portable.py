"""Bootstrap scripts must parse and run on the shell users actually have.

MEASURED 2026-09-01: install.ps1 held 9 UTF-8 em-dashes and no BOM. Windows PowerShell
5.1 -- the default shell on Windows 10/11, and the one README:206 tells users to run --
reads a BOM-less .ps1 as the ANSI codepage, so every em-dash became three mojibake
characters. One of them sat inside an interpolated string at line 108 and the parser
derailed: 3 parse errors, the installer dead before its first statement. pwsh 7 parsed
it fine, which is why it survived to a 3.0 release candidate.

TWO checks, because they fail differently:
  * the ASCII assertion catches the CAUSE and runs on every platform, including the
    Linux CI leg where powershell.exe does not exist;
  * the 5.1 parser check catches ANY syntax defect, not just this one, but can only
    run where that engine is installed.
A single check would have been vacuous on one leg or blind to everything else.
