"""`x4live archive` — get the ground truth OUT of a file the game overwrites.

WHY THIS COMMAND EXISTS, recorded here because the reason is the design. The engine's
resolved values are the only ground truth we have for what our merged tree *should*
say. They cost a play session to produce. And they live in `{profile}/uidata.xml`,
which X4 rewrites on every exit.

One was already lost that way: the probe was removed, the game exited, the file was
rewritten, and the fixture for the F72 traversals went with it — leaving four example
values that survived only because someone had quoted them into a document. **A file
the game owns is not storage.**

So the contract under test is narrow and blunt: it must copy BYTES, refuse anything it
cannot decode first, refuse anything implausibly small, and prove the copy by reading
it back. Every one of those has a twin below that makes it go red.
