r"""`x4lock` must actually stop a write, and must never claim a lock it did not verify.

WHY. Four irreplaceable files were destroyed here in twelve days by writes from inside
other processes -- where a command-string hook cannot see them. The read-only attribute
is the only layer that can. This pins what it does and, just as importantly, what it
does NOT do, so the docstring's table cannot quietly drift from the behaviour.

THE CONTROL IS THE POINT. Every "blocked" row is paired with the same primitive run
against an UNLOCKED file. Without that pairing a broken probe reads as a working lock:
measured 2026-09-04, the `bash` on Windows PATH is the WSL stub, it cannot open a
`C:/...` path, and its failure was recorded as `rm -f` being blocked. It is not.
