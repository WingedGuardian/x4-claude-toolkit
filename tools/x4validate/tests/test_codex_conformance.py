"""Cross-agent conformance (spec 7.2): every guard case in scripts/test-hooks.sh, replayed through
the Claude hooks AND through the full Codex chain (codex-entry wrapper -> adapter -> guards) in
NATIVE Codex shape, must reach the SAME verdict.

The mechanism is the x4conformance engine (`x4guard conformance`, scripts/x4conformance.py) with
the Codex profile (scripts/conformance-profiles/codex.json) -- ONE mechanism, the same one any
other agent's adapter is held to (ADAPTING.md). Both verdicts are taken NOW, in the same kept
sandbox and env; the expected verdict is never hard-coded -- it is whatever the Claude hook says
(the guards are the policy; this suite checks the Codex translation keeps it). Per item, never a
total.

  Claude verdict: the hook script itself on the Claude-shaped payload (independent of x4guard),
                  re-run under X4_GUARD_CHECK=1 to tell "checked nothing" (inert) apart.
  Codex verdict:  the profile's native payloads -- Bash -> captured bash_powershell fixture,
                  X4_CODEX_SHELL=bash (POSIX stand-in, M9); PowerShell -> same fixture,
                  X4_CODEX_SHELL=powershell; Edit -> an apply_patch Update File; Write -> an
                  apply_patch Add File carrying the content -- decoded by the profile's output
                  rules (a deny "NEEDS YOUR APPROVAL:" -> ask; "X4 GUARD INERT" -> inert).
                  Grep/Glob/NotebookEdit, and payloads Codex cannot produce (no path, no
                  command), are counted as no_native_analogue.

The dump's sandbox lives under <repo>/.test-sandbox (the conftest `conformance_dump` fixture),
never the system temp folder: test-hooks.sh refuses a sandbox under /tmp, which is where pytest
puts tmp_path on Linux.

Slow (~130 cases through PowerShell + Python + bash): runs in parallel, 6 workers.
