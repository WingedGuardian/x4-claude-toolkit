"""C10: an overlay that could not be READ must not leave the store saying 'base'.

`_merge.MergeResult.skipped` states its own contract: *"overlays that could not be
parsed and were left out of the tree. Without this channel a malformed overlay is
indistinguishable from an absent one, and the resulting tree looks complete when it
is not."* `_check.py` honours it in three places. `_effective._merge_one` returned
`(res.tree, rec)` and dropped it.

⚠ AND THE EXCEPTION HANDLER COULD NOT COVER FOR IT. `build` wraps each `_merge_one`
in `except etree.LxmlError`, which reads like a skip channel -- but `overlay_root`
catches `XMLSyntaxError` internally, so nothing ever escapes for an OVERLAY file.
That handler can only fire for the base file's own `parse_file`. The tests below
therefore go through a real malformed overlay, not a mocked raise: a mocked
exception would exercise the one path that already worked and prove nothing.
