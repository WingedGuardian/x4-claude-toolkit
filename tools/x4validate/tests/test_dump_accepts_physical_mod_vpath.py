"""`x4effective dump` must not answer a wrong-FORM query with a confident ABSENCE.

MEASURED 2026-08-27 (F71, root cause corrected): `dump --chain md/morerooms.xml`
returns rc 0 with `sources: moreroomsforships:full, ...`, while the same document
addressed as `extensions/moreroomsforships/md/morerooms.xml` returns rc 1 and
"no effective content". The information was always reachable; the query was in the
PHYSICAL form (a disk path under the extensions root) and `build_touch_map` keys by
the LOGICAL vpath -- the one the engine builds.

The asymmetry is real and NOT a bug in itself: for a DLC, `extensions/ego_dlc_split/...`
IS the game vpath, which is why `build_touch_map` deliberately does not rewrite those.
For a MOD the same shape is a disk path with no engine meaning. What IS a bug is
rendering that as an absence: 1,713 of 3,257 touched vpaths are mod-owned.

⚠ `logical_vpath` is a COMPOUND condition, so there is one falsification twin PER
CLAUSE below -- each trips exactly one guard and passes all the others. A single twin
only ever tests the first clause it hits (gotcha #26); two mutants survived that
mistake earlier in this same session.
