# Why you can trust this toolkit — and exactly where you cannot

This is the honest answer to *"how do I know these tools are telling me the truth?"*

It is not a claim that the toolkit is bug-free. Fifty-nine defects have been found in
it so far, and the sixtieth exists. All but one were caught by the toolkit or its own
gates rather than by a user getting a wrong answer — the exception is **F58**, and it is
named here rather than rounded away: a correct, documented capability went unused, a
hand-rolled substitute produced a confidently wrong answer, and that answer reached a
planning document before anyone re-derived it. No tool misbehaved; the routing did. The claim is narrower and checkable:

> **Every defect SHAPE that has occurred here has a test or gate that mechanically
> bans its recurrence; every answer that could be wrong carries a denominator and a
> freshness stamp; and where the engine can arbitrate, it does.**

An "audit found nothing" is not evidence — that criterion resets every time someone
looks harder. The table below is the evidence, and each row cites the file that
enforces it, so *"is this shape guarded?"* is a lookup rather than a feeling.

## The defect register

| # | Defect shape | MEASURED cost when it happened | What bans it now |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Enumeration narrowing** — a walk that sees only part of the corpus (loose files only, so packed mods and the two packed mini-DLC are invisible) | BaseX `x4eff` held **23 of 142** mini-DLC documents (16%) and reported success. The same shape was written **7 times** in different files | `tests/test_no_loose_only_reference_walk.py`, `tests/test_no_packed_only_scan.py`; one shared helper (`_scan.iter_mod_xml`, `_effective.base_vpaths`) that every caller must use. **Recurred 2026-08-24 inside the test runner itself**: the guard against orphaned BaseX tests pinned a *shrinking* file list but not a growing one, so 22 newly added tests were collected by nothing and nothing said so. A guard whose denominator comes from its own hand-maintained list can only ever be as complete as that list; it now discovers the files on disk |
| 2 | **Wrong population** — the check covers a different set than the finding | A `modulegroups` census reported **200** groups from 9 sources; the answer was **146** from 5, because `reference/` and `extensions/ego_dlc_*` are the same content counted twice | `gates/tool_properties.py`; the routing table in `CLAUDE.md`; `_scan.iter_corpus_xml` excludes `ego_dlc_*` by construction |
| 3 | **Wrong mod scope** — "installed on disk" used where "what the engine loads" was meant | One disabled mod put 3 macros into the effective index as live, named it in 4 collision rows, and let **Tier B resolve a selector against it and report OK** — a false pass in the mode built to catch silent no-ops | `tests/test_mod_scope_is_explicit.py` (scope must be a **literal**), `_registry.mods(scope)` with scope positional and required |
| 4 | **A stale artifact answering for a world that moved** | BaseX `x4eff` served pre-merge-fix values for **11 days**; on rebuild **140 of 194** engine-thrust rows changed, with no input file altered | `_freshness.py` two-axis fingerprint (content + engine bytes); `ask.py` and `gates/claims_audit.py` **refuse** rather than answer from a stale store. ⚠ **Partial, and the gap is known:** the content axis hashes each mod's own `content.xml` but never opens the **profile** manifest, which is the third term of "which mods are active" — so a mod being **enabled or disabled** cannot move the fingerprint and the artifact reports FRESH across that change. Additions and removals DO move it (positive control: 3 deployments, 123→126 folders, hash moved). Open, tracked |
| 5 | **A silent no-op reported as applied** | A bare `continue` dropped **858** root-`<replace>` operations while marking them applied, so the effective store served vanilla values for real mod overrides | `AppliedOp.ok` must carry a reason; `gates/noop_audit.py` re-proves it corpus-wide |
| 6 | **A zero rendered as a finding** — "nothing found" reported without saying whether anything was looked at, or a verdict that ignores evidence the same tool printed | A corpus sweep threw on **all 4,391 files**, swallowed it, and reported *"0 dangling across 115 mods"* when the answer was 3 | `CorpusScan.verdict()` **raises** rather than render a zero over an empty population; `ask.py` requires a coverage denominator before printing a negative. ⚠ **A second form of this was found 2026-08-25 and is worth knowing:** the corpus sweep's crash detector looked only for a Python traceback, so **173 of 242 runs (71.5%) killed by the OS loader before Python started** were counted as clean — while the gate's own output printed `exit 3221225794: 121` four lines above `CRASHES/HANGS: 0`. The evidence was not hidden; the verdict simply never consulted it. It now classifies on the exit code, and the corroborating tell is recorded too: that run took 193s where a healthy one takes 1219s, and **a gate that suddenly gets much faster is reporting on itself** |
| 7 | **The checker was wrong, not the code** | **83 of 83** checking-step errors were the instrument, not the finding — that is this repository's own count across twelve sessions; the wider workspace register that also covers shell and OS instruments (`ls`, `awk`, `comm`, `git status` on Windows) stands higher, and the two are deliberately different populations rather than a disagreement — most recently a probe for *"what does `attr` do with an unknown KIND?"* that used `ship`, which is a real stored kind (514 entities) — it returned the predicted confident zero for the wrong reason entirely (an unknown PROP), and only `ls ship` returning 514 rows separated the two defects; before that a line-ending pin verified by reading the RULE (`.gitattributes`, `git check-attr`) and never counting a `\r\n` in the bytes the hash actually reads, which left the engine hash machine-local for two days (**F67**) — most recently a gate reporting a **814× performance regression** that was the machine having been asleep, and a TSV reader that took a comment line as its header and reported "0 problems" over an **empty population**. Earlier ones: `$?` after a pipeline, a text splitter arbitrating a structured format, an AST scan under the wrong interpreter reporting a file "unparseable", a "cold" verification that was warm because path resolution walks up to a config file, and a unit test whose verdict came from a mutable artifact outside its fixture — most recently, and it is the cleanest specimen in the row: a doc edit verified against a hand-rolled backup that **was a week old**, because the `cp` that should have made it lived in a command bash rejected at PARSE time, so none of it ran. The diff reported *2547 lines added* against a true answer of **52 insertions, 1 deletion**. Nothing was wrong with the file. **For a TRACKED file, git is the baseline** — `git diff --numstat` needs no backup, cannot be stale, and cannot be another session's (F76) — and the 2026-08-29 hook work added seven at once, of which two are worth naming: a false-positive rate measured as **300 of 300 allow** because the replay environment left the paths unconfigured, so the rules being measured *could not fire* (a vacuous 100%, caught only by adding a positive control that had to produce a deny before any rate was quoted); and a rule that flagged `uv run --frozen python -m pytest` as a bare interpreter call because its lookbehind only inspected the seven characters before `python` — **52 hits, of which the true count was 2**, found by SAMPLING the matches rather than trusting the total | Planted-truth gates (`gates/diff_truth.py`, `gates/oracle*.py`) — the checker is validated against known answers; every AST guard **raises** on a parse failure instead of skipping; `scripts/verify-cold.sh` **refuses to run until it has proven the environment is unconfigured**. ⚠ **2026-08-29 — this row's claim was briefly FALSE, and the reason is worth more than the instance.** A coverage checker keyed on `argv[0]`; that broke for a single-command CLI, was fixed, given falsification twins, and mutation-tested per clause — then recurred immediately on a THIRD argv shape (a global flag before the subcommand), publishing a coverage figure of 17 where the answer is 13. **Watching a test fail proves the feature is absent; mutating the finished code proves the test is present; neither proves the ENUMERATION of cases is complete**, and no number of twins of the same kind closes that. The fix is therefore a guard on the CLASS: the subcommand is searched for against the LIVE surface, and a cell where none can be found is recorded as UNDECIDABLE — so a FOURTH shape surfaces as a finding instead of silently shrinking the covered set (F75) |
| 8 | **An aggregate hiding a per-item regression** | Two mods went **2.8 s → 112 s** and **2.4 s → 121 s** while the total moved **1.00×**, because a third got faster | `gates/perf_guard.py` compares **items, never totals**. ⚠ **The same gate had the opposite defect until 2026-08-25**, and it is worth knowing about: its clock advances while the machine is *suspended*, so a sweep left running overnight reported a **814× regression** on a mod that re-timed at **3.47 s**. A timing that spans a suspend is a non-answer, not a finding. A suspected regression is now **re-timed once** and reported only if it reproduces; one that cannot be re-timed is reported UNCONFIRMED and still fails, because "could not check" is not "not a regression" |
| 9 | **Two doors to one question** — the same thing resolved by two independent code paths | Tier B and `x4effective` gave contradictory answers about the same value, each internally consistent | One implementation per question; `gates/cross_tool.py` asserts tools agree |
| 10 | **An executable that resolves its own environment** — instead of delegating to the one resolver | A fingerprint script defaulted to a developer's absolute path: on any other machine it fingerprinted nothing and reported **FRESH forever**. A corpus build did the same and would index **zero documents, exit 0** | `tests/test_env_resolution_is_delegated.py` (AST, with a scoped escape hatch); `scripts/verify-cold.sh` runs all 9 CLIs on a genuinely cold checkout. **This row overclaimed until 2026-08-24**: the guard detected only `os.environ`/`os.getenv`, so a hardcoded absolute-path *literal* — the form this very defect shipped in — was invisible to it, and one survived in `tools/basex/stage.py`. It now covers literals too, and three further scripts that returned **rc 1 ("has findings") instead of rc 2 ("not configured")** were found by running them cold, not by reading them |
| 11 | **Failing late, and blaming the wrong component** — the error a user actually sees names something other than the cause | Reproduced 2026-08-24: with no JVM installed, the corpus tool reported `BaseX query failed: [WinError 2]` — blaming BaseX for a missing Java. With no index built it printed a raw resource error and **never named the build script**, because the one line that does sits on a code path an unbuilt index can never reach. The build script spent its entire multi-minute staging pass before reaching the check that would fail | One shared `preflight.py`, called by all three entry points, that checks the JVM (floor read from the shipped jar's own bytecode level, not chosen), the jar, the index, `uv` and free disk **before** any long work, and refuses with **exit 2**. 24 tests exercise every check in **both** directions, including that an unrecognised `java -version` banner refuses rather than assuming a pass. ⚠ **The same row's defect recurred inside the fix, and was caught before shipping (2026-08-25):** the preflight reported *“the database has not been built”* over a database that was built and queryable, because the vendoring left out a 0-byte upstream marker and BaseX had silently relocated its home. A first run would have been *build → told to build*, forever. The check now looks for the marker and names the relocation |
| 12 | **A capability that exists, is correct, and is never reached** — the failure is routing, not code | A gap was filed against a command that already answered it. A throwaway script hand-rolled a base-only substitute and labelled **65 of 241 vpaths (27%)** as renamed-and-deletable when they were mod-supplied and actually WIN those paths. MEASURED alongside it: **21 of 30** CLI subcommands (70%) appear in no routing surface | A row in `CLAUDE.md`'s Discovery-vs-Proof table — the only surface always in context. Deliberately **not** a new helper: the one added for this exact trap the day before had **zero callers**, and deliberately **not** a lint, because the failure was in a throwaway script and no linter covers those (F58) |
| 13 | **A tool that breaks the tree on purpose, and cannot put it back if it dies** | The mutation gate restored its target in a `finally:`, which does not run on SIGKILL — so a killed run left a deliberately-broken TRACKED file that `git status` shows as an ordinary modification. **v2.5.0 shipped that way once**: ambiguous-`sel` detection silently disabled in a public release. REPRODUCED by a real kill, not simulated | Pristine copies taken before the first mutation plus a `.mutation-probe-active` marker, so recovery never depends on the thing that failed. A killed run makes the next invocation **refuse with exit 2** and name `--recover`, which restores and says WHICH file was poisoned. A second party can see the marker without asking — **a control only one side can see is still an assurance** (F59) |
| 14 | **A copy that is not the thing it copies** — and a proof that reports non-findings | Porting dev to the public mirror one FILE at a time has no notion of a COMMIT. A five-file change set crossed over in part: two files, and only because they had independently been edited by the porter. Public `master` then shipped a stale-artifact message instructing users to run a subcommand the public build does not have — nothing crashed, so nothing noticed. The documented proof was `diff -rq`, which on these two trees reports **52 differences where 12 are real**; the other 40 are line endings, and both repos store identical bytes. A proof that buries findings under non-findings teaches you to skip it | `scripts/verify-port.py` classifies every tracked file into buckets that must **sum to the population**, compares **committed blobs** rather than working-tree files, treats an unlisted dev-only file as a FINDING rather than a default, and runs the identifier matcher over the port subset before anything is copied. `--selftest` proves it can fail on four planted defects (F60, F61, F62) |

## What the guarantees actually are

**A negative answer carries its denominator, or it is refused.** "Nothing references X"
is only printed when the tool can say *over how many documents* it looked and name
every exclusion. A bare zero is a lead, never a fact.

**A stored answer says when it was true.** Every persisted artifact carries a two-axis
fingerprint: the installed content, and a hash of the merge/enumeration engine's own
bytes. A merge fix changes the right answer for identical inputs — so the artifact
goes stale and the tools say so, rather than serving the old answer confidently.

**The engine axis hashes source BYTES, so a comment change marks artifacts stale.**
That is deliberate, and worth stating because it looks like a fault the first time
it happens: demonstrated 2026-08-24, when a two-line comment edit moved the engine
fingerprint and every derived artifact reported STALE with nothing semantic
changed. The alternative — deciding which edits "really" change behaviour — needs
an equivalence oracle nobody has, and would fail in the one direction that
matters, by calling a real change cosmetic. A spurious rebuild costs minutes; a
missed one silently serves wrong values, as it did for eleven days. Rebuild after
editing the merge sources, even if you only touched a comment.

**And the cry-wolf cost is now measured, which is what settles the argument.**
MEASURED 2026-08-26: a two-line addition to `_effective.py` (an import and one
guard call, both provably unreachable from extraction or merge) moved the engine
hash and staled every derived artifact. A parallel session had **21 published
figures** stamped with the superseded hash. Re-deriving all 21 against the rebuilt
store took **one script and about a minute**, and **21 of 21 reproduced exactly**.
So the false alarm cost a minute; the eleven-day false FRESH cost a design decision
written on vanilla values mistaken for a mod's. **A conservative hash that
occasionally cries wolf is cheap precisely because confirming the wolf is absent is
cheap** — which is the argument against ever softening this into a
"did-it-really-matter" heuristic. Note also where the value showed up: not in the
tool that changed, but in a different consumer having to ask whether its own
published numbers were still true.

⚠ **With one measured hole, stated here rather than left for you to find.** The content
axis reads each installed mod's own manifest, but not the profile manifest that records
which mods are *enabled*. Installing or removing a mod moves the fingerprint; **toggling
one on or off does not** — so across that one change an artifact reports FRESH while
describing a different game. If you have enabled or disabled a mod since your last
build, rebuild rather than trusting the banner.

**A guess never wears the grammar of a measurement.** Provenance travels with the
value; nothing derived from a guess is promoted into a confident state.

**An unconfigured toolkit refuses.** Every CLI exits **2** — never 0 with a
plausible-looking answer computed from a directory that does not exist, and never 1,
which means "the thing you asked about has findings".

**The engine is the referee where it can be.** `x4debug crosscheck` compares what the
game actually skipped against what the validator predicted, per item. It found 1,206
false positives in our own tool — the half of the comparison Egosoft wrote cannot be
fooled by our assumptions.

---

## Where you cannot trust it (stated, not hidden)

- **Load order between mods is community convention, not engine-documented.** Any
  result that turns on *which mod won* is advisory and says so.
- **Every finding is recorded individually** — F1–F71, each with a measured cost, and
  where a limit was accepted rather than fixed, the reason it was accepted. The
  per-finding register (`docs/BLIND-SPOTS.md`) lives in the development tree because
  its evidence cites a specific private modlist by name; the findings fixed in each
  release are summarised in `CHANGELOG.md`, and the shapes are the table above.
- **A clean validate is necessary, not sufficient.** It does not replace an in-game
  test and a `debug.txt` read. The reference/completeness catalog is partial.
- **BaseX indexes are discovery instruments.** Use the effective store for claims
  about live values.
- **Windows is the tested platform, and on Linux there is a specific unfixed gap —
  do not read a green Linux test run as a Linux guarantee.** X4's own filesystem
  folds case; NTFS does too, so the toolkit never had to. Four lookups compare
  paths case-sensitively, and on a case-sensitive filesystem a mod shipping `MD/`
  or `AIScripts/` resolves to nothing. **One of the four fails silently** — the
  subtree simply contributes zero files and nothing says so, which by this
  document's own standard is worse than the three that fail loudly. Note the
  inconsistency this produces: packed archives ARE read case-insensitively, so on
  Linux a packed mod resolves while its loose twin does not.
  Linux CI runs and is expected to pass, but it is **informational, not gating**,
  precisely because passing tests do not close that gap. It will be promoted to a
  gate when the case-folding work lands, not before.

## How to check any of this yourself

```bash
uv run python -m pytest -q          # the suite
bash scripts/verify-cold.sh         # behaves on a machine with no X4 installed
uv run python gates/<name>.py       # any single gate; see gates/README.md
```

Every gate prints its denominator. If one prints a finding without one, that is a bug
in the gate, and it is the kind we most want reported.
