r"""Correctness PROPERTIES for the three tools with the thinnest coverage.

Gate coverage was uneven. x4validate had six gates, x4effective three, x4compat
determinism, x4modlist two. `x4diff`, `x4xref` and `x4stats` had only `qa_sweep`
cells — which assert a tool RUNS and prints something, not that what it prints
is TRUE. "Exits 0 with output" is precisely the bar a confidently-wrong tool
clears.

So this gate checks properties that must hold regardless of input, each one
falsifiable and checked against ground truth derived INDEPENDENTLY of the tool
being tested (a fresh lxml parse of the same file, not the tool's own index):

  x4diff   identity      diff(A,A) is empty for every A.
           antisymmetry  diff(A,B).added == diff(B,A).removed, and vice versa.
                         A tool can look right on one direction and still have
                         old/new swapped; only the pair catches that.
  x4xref   citations     every "defined at file:line" it prints must really
                         have that cue at that line. A wrong line silently
                         sends the user to the wrong place.
           completeness  cues found by an independent parse must be in the index
                         — reported WITH a denominator, never as a bare count.
  x4stats  fidelity      every numeric it reports for a macro must equal the
                         value in the file, re-parsed from scratch.
  x4compat soundness     every mod named in a collision must really ship that
                         vpath, and the winner must be one of them. A conflict
                         detector that invents a conflict is as bad as one that
                         misses it.
           completeness  a shared FULL-FILE path is either reported or a known
                         non-override class (per-mod manifest, union-merged
                         registry). NOT "any shared vpath must collide" -- two
                         diffs on disjoint nodes legitimately do not.
           name-clash    the ENTITY-level kind gets its own invariants: every
                         named mod must really DEFINE that macro, and no
                         load-order winner may be claimed (index/macros.xml
                         decides). Its composite vpath makes the two file-level
                         properties above inapplicable, so it is checked
                         separately rather than waved through.
  x4similar monotonicity results at a LOWER threshold must be a superset of
                         those at a higher one. A scoring bug breaks this even
                         when every individual run looks plausible.

#:                and 22,966 entities UNCHANGED, entity+value multiset identical (0

    MEASURED 2026-08-22: `(kind, name)` is duplicated across 63 groups (90 extra rows),
