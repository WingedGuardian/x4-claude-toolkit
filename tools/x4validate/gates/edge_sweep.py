"""Edge sweep — hostile and degenerate inputs against every CLI.

Smoke tests prove the happy path. This proves the tools FAIL WELL: a clear
message and a sane exit code, never a traceback and never a confident wrong
answer. Covers empty mods, malformed manifests, missing args, absent paths, and
an unconfigured environment (the state a new user is actually in).

Every cell carries the exit codes that count as FAILING WELL for it
(AUDIT-2026-09-24 GT-4). Judging only tracebacks scored `x4validate <missing dir>`
exiting 0 with "OK" as handled -- the confident wrong answer this sweep exists to
catch. The sets were MEASURED 2026-09-25 (39 cells) and then judged: a cell whose
measured rc was itself a wrong answer is pinned to the RIGHT code, not the
observed one (see `x4xref who-calls ''`).

Run:  uv run python gates/edge_sweep.py [--verbose]
Exit: 0 every cell exited within its expected set, 1 any traceback, hang, or
      exit code outside the cell's expected set.
