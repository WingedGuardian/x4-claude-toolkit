"""Reverse oracle — the direction the other two structurally cannot test.

`oracle.py` and `oracle_index.py` replay operations the engine REJECTED and
require us to reject them too. That proves "we never say fine where the engine
said broken" — but a failure-only log can never prove completeness, and both
gates say so in their own output.

This gate asks the other question: **the engine complained about something; do
WE notice it at all?** A miss here is a false OK of the worst kind, because the
user is told their mod is clean while the game is logging errors about it.

Two checkable classes from a real captured log:

  A. `GetText(pageid=P, textid=T) TextID not found!`
     -> the effective `t/` tree must NOT contain that id. If we resolve it, our
        `{page,t}` reference check would tell a user the reference is fine.

  B. `Cannot find referenced part template '<X>' in file 'index\\components'`
     -> `<X>` must NOT be resolvable in the effective component index.

Both are answered from the merged tree, so this needs no game launch — only a
captured log ($X4_ORACLE_LOG, or the live profile log passed explicitly).

Run:  uv run python gates/oracle_reverse.py [path/to/debug.txt]
Exit: 0 we agree with the engine, 1 any disagreement, 2 a NON-ANSWER -- no log,
      a log with no checkable complaint, or our own side not examined at all.
