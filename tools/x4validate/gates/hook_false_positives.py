"""Replay every historical Bash command through protect-bash.sh, on a STABLE hook.

WHY. Every guard rule that was ever exercised turned out to be wrong the first time
it ran for real (F79: none had ever executed; then six false positives in a day).
Replaying 10,000+ commands that all RAN FINE at the time is the cheap way to find
the rest -- any deny or advise is the guard's own verdict on work that needed doing.

CONTROLS FIRST. An earlier attempt scored a perfect 300 of 300 allow -- vacuous,
because the replay environment lacked X4_TOOLKIT and no path rule could fire. Then
`subprocess.run(["bash", ...])` resolved to WSL's bash, whose empty stdout read as
"allow" for every command. A harness that cannot produce a deny cannot measure a
false-positive rate; this one refuses to report unless a known-bad command comes
back `deny` AND a harmless one comes back `allow`.

STABLE INSTRUMENT (2026-08-30). The first F82 baseline was measured while the live
hook was REDEPLOYED mid-run (launched 22:28, hook deployed 00:08:29, finished
00:15:36). Bash re-reads the script on every spawn, so the tail of that run used a
different rule set from the head, and its per-rule table was not reproducible. This
version hashes the hook files (and the optional x4-paths.env they source) before and
after, re-resolves the paths at the end, and VOIDS the run if anything moved.

COUNTS, NOT EXAMPLES. The first artifact stored 25 examples per rule and no
counts, so "1,450" and "25" were indistinguishable in the file. And it overwrote
its own baseline on every run, so nothing could ever be diffed.

NO ALLOW FROM A FAILURE (code review 2026-08-30). A per-command hook failure --
MEASURED: `JQ=no_such_binary` gives rc 0, EMPTY stdout and stderr noise, because
protect-bash.sh exits 0 on an empty $COMMAND -- used to be read as "allow". Now a
non-zero rc, or an empty verdict beside stderr noise, is a refusal.

Run:  uv run python gates/hook_false_positives.py [--record] [--limit=N]
                                                  [--workers=N] [--prove-parallel=N]
                                                  [--out=PATH]
      --out writes the artifact there and skips the compare.
      --record with --limit is refused unless --out is given: a partial baseline
      would make every later compare a clean "no drift" over N commands.
      The transcript directory comes from toolkit_usage.transcript_dir
      (honours --transcripts DIR / X4_TRANSCRIPTS like every other gate).
Exit: 0 no drift (or recorded) / 1 drift on shared commands / 2 refused
      (unconfigured, controls failed, hook changed under the run, empty corpus,
      no or partial baseline) / 3 unexpected exception (never 1: 1 means DRIFT).

Compare mode diffs per RULE over the INTERSECTION of commands present in both
runs, so a growing corpus never reads as a rule change (CLAUDE.md, concurrent
sessions rule 5: design a measurement to survive drift). A rule SWAP (two commands
trading rules, delta 0 each) is reported as moved pairs, not hidden by the sums.
