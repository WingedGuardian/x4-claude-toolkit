r"""Techniques the other 19 gates do not apply at all.

Written after noticing that the previous round stopped because I asked the
stopping question, not because the search was exhausted — and that the question
itself found three more issues. So: what has NOTHING checked yet?

  1. SENSITIVITY. `tool_properties` proves x4diff is self-consistent (identity,
     antisymmetry). Both hold TRIVIALLY for a tool that under-reports — a diff
     that always answered "no changes" passes them. Nothing ever verified it
     DETECTS a known planted delta, or that the counts are the RIGHT numbers.

  2. CROSS-TOOL AGREEMENT. Every audit so far compares a tool to itself or to a
     fresh parse. Two different tools answering the same question differently is
     a whole failure class nothing looks for: x4compat names a winner for a
     contested file; x4effective records an origin for entities in that file.
     They must be the same mod -- but ONLY for the kinds where `winner` means
     "supplies the live value". It does not mean that for SUBTREE (the winner is
     the WIPER) or NAME-CLASH (deliberately empty), so the assertion is PER KIND.
     Until 2026-08-13 this checked FULL-OVERRIDE alone -- 14 of 445 collisions,
     3.1%, with HARD/SUBTREE/UNION-KEY never verified against the store at all.

  3. BUILDER IDEMPOTENCE. `determinism_audit` covers x4compat's output ordering.
     The BUILDERS were never checked: build the same store twice from unchanged
     inputs and the contents must be identical. A builder that varies is one
     whose every downstream answer is unreproducible.

  4. READ-ONLY HARDENING. `qa_sweep` proves `x4effective sql` rejects DELETE.
     That is one verb. ATTACH, PRAGMA, and multi-statement payloads are the ways
     a "read-only" SQL surface actually gets subverted.

Run:  uv run python gates/cross_tool.py
Exit: 0 all checks hold, 1 any violation, 2 a section could not run (no/stale
      store, or a collision kind whose every row was uncheckable -- 0 of N is a
      non-answer, not agreement).
