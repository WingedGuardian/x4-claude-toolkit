"""Mutation probe — does the suite actually KILL a broken detector, or just pass?

A passing test count is a count, not a quality. The only honest measure is: break
the code deliberately and see whether anything notices. A mutant that SURVIVES is
a line the suite does not really check — which is exactly how a `continue` that
discarded 858 mod operations sat in `_do_replace` for months with a green suite
above it.

WHY THIS COVERS MORE THAN `_merge.py` NOW (F54 mitigation 2). F54 records that a
mutation window can turn a sound assertion VACUOUS: with the ambiguous-`sel`
guard disabled, an assertion that it did NOT fire cannot go red. The general form
of that worry is "which of our detectors would nobody notice losing?", and a
mutant is the only positive control that cannot itself go vacuous. MEASURED
2026-08-25: 6/6 killed on `_merge.py` — those detectors are provably checked, and
nothing else had that proof.

Each mutation is a small, plausible edit against a guard whose failure has a
MEASURED cost in docs/BLIND-SPOTS.md or CLAUDE.md. That selection rule is
load-bearing: a contrived mutant that nothing kills is noise, not a finding.

⚠ THIS GATE DELIBERATELY BREAKS THE WORKING TREE WHILE IT RUNS. The mutated file
is a TRACKED file, so the tree looks normal — that is gotcha #27's actual lesson,
and it is why `.mutation-probe-active` exists and why you should tell anyone
sharing the tree before starting.

Run:  uv run python gates/mutation_probe.py [--verbose] [--recover]
Exit: 0 every mutant killed · 1 survivors or hangs · 2 cannot run (see --recover)

#:
#: NOT hygiene -- without this the gate returns WRONG VERDICTS. CPython invalidates a

#: the previous mutant's failures.
#:
#: `scripts/verify-hook-tests.py` already carries this fix and records the measurement:
#: 2 of 54 mutants reported "NOT CAUGHT" while each, reproduced by hand, turned its
#: target test red -- the tell being that the failing tests named belonged to the
#: mutant BEFORE it. This gate mutates `_merge.py` the same way and had no such guard.
#:
#: It bites the RESTORE too, which is the worse direction and the one measured on
#: 2026-09-03: a mutant turning `return 2` into `return 0` is identical in LENGTH, so
#: after restoring the pristine source -- verified byte-identical by sha256 -- the
#: stale .pyc was still imported and every later test in that session ran the MUTANT
#: while the file on disk was correct. A byte-identity check cannot see this: it looks
