r"""LOAD ORDER ORACLE — does `compute_load_order` agree with the order the ENGINE used?

WHY THIS EXISTS. `_loadorder.compute_load_order` decides the winner of every collision
between mods (x4compat, x4effective, x4stats, Tier B). Until 2026-09-24 nothing ever
compared it with the engine: every test and the #13 mutant compared the code with
itself. MEASURED that day on a 125-mod install, the order the code produced agreed with
the engine at 0 of 23 first-pass positions (AUDIT-2026-09-24 LO-1).

THE EVIDENCE IT READS. At startup and while loading, the engine checks the signature of
every extension file it opens, and an unsigned mod file logs

    [FileIO ] 0.00 File I/O: Failed to verify the file signature for file
              '.\extensions\<folder>\<relative path>' (error: 14)

For every relative path (a "file class" -- `libraries/wares.xml`, `t/0001-l044.xml`, ...)
the ORDER in which different mods' copies are checked is the order the engine walked the
extensions for that file. Each class shipped by two or more mods yields ordered pairs;
this gate counts the pairs the computed order INVERTS. It does not assume which rule the
engine uses -- it scores whatever `compute_load_order` returns.

SCOPE, stated so a pass is not read as more than it is:
  * Only mods that ship at least one unsigned file appear (in practice: every mod).
  * Only the relative order of mods that SHARE a file class is tested; two mods that
    never ship the same path are never compared. The denominator (pairs, classes,
    mods covered) is printed on every run.
  * The log describes the modlist AT THAT LAUNCH. Whether it still describes the current
    one is decided BEFORE any verdict, so a stale log can neither convict nor clear the
    code: the gate refuses (rc 2, naming the cause) when a mod manifest or the profile
    content.xml changed after the log was written, when a logged folder is no longer
    installed (e.g. a removed probe mod), or when an active game-root mod ships a file
    class the engine logged for other mods but never for it (it was not in that launch).
  * A mod that IS installed but that our active rule EXCLUDES, yet the engine logged, is
    a FINDING (rc 1): our model of what loads disagrees with the engine. It is judged
    only on a log no older than the manifests and profile and naming no removed folder
    (a dependency removed since the launch would explain the exclusion); otherwise it is
    listed in the refusal.

INPUT: `$X4_ORACLE_LOG` (a pinned capture) if set, else the live profile debug.txt.

Exit: 0 no inversions over >= 1 comparable class, on a log of the current modlist ·
1 inversions, or a logged mod our active rule excludes · 2 cannot judge (no log, nothing
comparable, or a log that does not describe the current modlist).
