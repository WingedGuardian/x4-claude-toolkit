"""QA sweep — exercise EVERY tool x EVERY subcommand against the real install.

Written 2026-08-08 after a defect (root-<replace> silently dropped, reported as
applied) survived three sessions because nothing ever exercised that path. The
point is to find bugs here, not while using the tools.

Each cell records: exit code, stdout size, and whether it crashed. A cell is
RED on an unhandled traceback or an unexpected exit code; YELLOW when it runs
but returns nothing useful (a possible unfinished feature); GREEN otherwise.

Run:  uv run python gates/qa_sweep.py [--verbose]
Exit: 0 all green, 1 any red, 3 only yellows.

# COVERAGE: does this sweep actually exercise EVERY subcommand it claims to?
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. The docstring at the top of this file says "EVERY tool x
# EVERY subcommand". CELLS is a hand-maintained literal and nothing compared the two,
# so the claim was aspiration, not fact. MEASURED 2026-08-30: 29 of 43 subcommands had
# a cell. It was found by accident -- a new `x4live harvest` subcommand was added and
# the sweep reported GREEN 58 / RED 0 having never run it.
#
# The exclusions below are not the defect. Some subcommands genuinely should not run in
# a sweep: they rebuild a store for minutes, call the Nexus API, or mutate the registry
# the sweep is inspecting. The defect was that NOTHING RECORDED WHICH, so a genuinely
# missed subcommand was indistinguishable from a considered omission -- exactly the
# shape `scripts/verify-port.py` already refuses with its ALLOW literal.

#: Subcommands deliberately NOT swept, each with the reason it is excluded. Anything
#: else uncovered is a FINDING, not a default. Keep the reason attached: an entry nobody
#: can justify is how an allow-list stops being a decision and starts being an excuse.
UNSWEPT: dict[tuple[str, str], str] = {
    # ⚠ NINE OF THESE TEN ARE A BRANCH ARTEFACT, AND THAT IS THE HONEST LABEL.
    #
    # They were originally excluded for being expensive, mutating or networked. MEASURED
    # 2026-08-30 against the `session/tooling` worktree: EVERY ONE of those objections is
    # already answered there by a redirect, and its cells are better than my reasons were:
    #
    #     x4effective build     env={X4_EFFECTIVE_DB: <sandbox>}, slow=True
    #     x4xref      build     --out <sandbox>, slow=True
    #     x4debug     baseline  --dest <sandbox>

    #     x4modlist   ingest / resolve / snapshot / ignore / mark   sandbox registry
    #
    # ★ THE ERROR WAS THE QUESTION. I asked "is this expensive or mutating?" when the
    # deciding question is "can a cell REDIRECT it?" -- reasoning from a subcommand's
    # nature instead of from what a cell can do about it. An exclusion a sandbox would
