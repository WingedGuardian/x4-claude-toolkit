"""QA sweep — exercise EVERY tool x EVERY subcommand against the real install.

Written 2026-08-08 after a defect (root-<replace> silently dropped, reported as
applied) survived three sessions because nothing ever exercised that path. The
point is to find bugs here, not while using the tools.

Each cell records: exit code, stdout size, and whether it crashed. A cell is
RED on an unhandled traceback or an unexpected exit code; YELLOW when it runs
but returns nothing useful (a possible unfinished feature); GREEN otherwise.

Run:  uv run python gates/qa_sweep.py [--verbose]
Exit: 0 all green, 1 any red, 3 only yellows.
