r"""Ask the corpus a question and get an answer that carries its own denominator.

The whole point
---------------
A discovery tool that cannot prove a negative is just a faster way to guess. Two
things stood between BaseX and a usable "nobody references X":

  Gap 1  62% of mod XML was PACKED and invisible  -> fixed by stage.py
  Gap 2  the index held files AS WRITTEN, not the effective tree -> fixed by x4eff
  Gap 3  SKIPCORRUPT drops files SILENTLY          -> fixed by coverage.py + this

Gap 3 is the one that turns "more complete" into "proof". A zero-result is only
a finding if you can say what it is zero *over*:

    "nothing references turret_x"                       <- not a claim
    "0 hits over 13,672 of 13,684 documents; the 12
     exclusions are malformed XML the engine also
     cannot read, listed by name"                       <- a claim

So this REFUSES to render a zero-result as a negative finding unless coverage.json
says the index is complete or fully accounted. A positive result needs no such
guard — one hit is one hit regardless of what else was missed.

The denominator counts every document in the database, so a zero is certified only for a
query that searched all of them:

  * A query addressing PART of a database inside a reach call's own arguments --
    doc(...), db:get('<db>', '<path>'), collection('<db>/<path>') -- or naming its
    database through a non-literal, or naming a database other than --db, is refused
    before it runs (rc 2).
  * An xq query is then scanned (comments removed, string-literal contents blanked) for
    TOKENS that can select documents by where they are rather than what they contain:
    document identity (document-uri, base-uri, db:path/fn:path, db:node-pre, db:node-id,
    generate-id), position (position, last, head, tail, subsequence, filter, for-each,
    fold-left and kin, a numeric predicate such as [1] or [$n], FLWOR `at $i` / `count $c`
    / windows), node order (<<, >>, is), the util:/hof:/array:/map:/random: modules, and
    anything ask.py cannot read through (a `#` function reference, a Q{...} EQName, query
    text evaluated from a string). If one is present the query still RUNS and its hits
    are reported, but a zero is NOT a negative (rc 4), and the line says which token.
    Selecting by CONTENT (`collection('x4eff')[.//ware]//x`) is not narrowing: every
    document was read. refs/attr are ask.py's own queries and are not scanned.

Which DB
--------
  --db x4raw  (default)  files as written  -> "who WROTE this, in which mod"
  --db x4eff             effective tree    -> "what does the ENGINE see"

Prefer x4eff for a claim about what is live; x4raw for provenance/authorship.

Usage
-----
  uv run python ask.py refs <macro_or_ware_id> [--db x4eff]
  uv run python ask.py attr <attribute-name>
  uv run python ask.py xq   '<raw xquery>'
  uv run python ask.py xq   --file <query.xq>

From Git Bash, pass an xq query with --file: MSYS rewrites path-like parts of command-line
arguments before Python sees them (`//` becomes `/`; a leading `/ware` becomes
`C:/Program Files/Git/ware`), and a zero from an argument there is refused.

# --- can the query narrow WHICH documents it addresses? (v3.3.0 release review) ------
#
# `_db_reaches` above reads INSIDE a reach call's own argument list. A query can narrow its
# scope just as well OUTSIDE it, and fu-ask (2026-09-26) answered with a list of narrowing
# SHAPES: an identity function tested in a predicate, a `where` clause or a comparison.
# MEASURED by the v3.3.0 release reviewer: 11 of 12 rewrites walked past that list -- a `let`
# then a `where` on the variable, an arrow into contains(), tokenize(...)[3], a switch, a
# filter() callback, subsequence(), `[position() le 9]`, db:node-pre, `collection#1(...)` --
# each printing "NEGATIVE CONFIRMED over the whole database", rc 0. A blocklist of SHAPES
# cannot converge: every way of USING a value is a new shape.
#
# So the rule is about TOKENS, not shapes. The query (comments removed, string-literal
# contents blanked) is searched ANYWHERE for a small set of things that can select documents
# by WHERE THEY ARE rather than by WHAT THEY CONTAIN. If one is present the query still runs
# and every hit is reported; only a ZERO loses its certificate (rc 4, "not a finding"). The
# asymmetry is deliberate: a token present in an innocent query costs one uncertified zero,
# printed with its reason; a token missed costs a false negative quoted as proof.
#
# Selecting by CONTENT -- `collection('x4eff')[.//ware]//x` -- is NOT in the set: every
# document was read and judged by what it holds, so the zero is a negative over all of them.
#
# Each class, and why it is in:
#   identity  document-uri base-uri path node-pre node-id generate-id -- a value that names a
#             document (or a node's place in one) instead of its content. `path` covers both
#             db:path and fn:path; fn:path encodes sibling POSITIONS, which is the next class.
#   position  position last subsequence(-where) head tail foot trunk slice items-at/-before/
#             -after/-starting-where/-ending-where take-while remove index-of index-where
#             partition, plus filter for-each for-each-pair fold-left fold-right: BaseX 12
#             implements XQuery 4, whose callbacks receive the item's POSITION as a second
#             argument, so a callback can select by position without spelling position().
#             Also the FLWOR `at $i` and `count $c` clauses and tumbling/sliding `window`.
#   numeric   a predicate that is a number, a variable, arithmetic over those, or a numeric
#   predicate function with no comparison in it (`[1]`, `[$n]`, `[count(.//x)]`) -- a
#             positional predicate. Anywhere, not only directly on a collection() call: once
#             a sequence is bound to a variable or parenthesised, a text scan cannot tell
#             documents from elements. `//ware[1]` therefore also loses its certificate.
#   order     `<<` `>>` `is` -- node identity and document order.
#   modules   util: hof: array: map: (positional and collision-deduplicating helpers; a map
#             keeps ONE value per key), random: (selection by chance), and `array {` / a
#             `?1` lookup (positional access into an array built from the documents).
#   indirect  `#` (a function reference: `collection#1('x4eff/libraries')` reaches a path
#             `_db_reaches` never sees), `Q{` (an EQName spells any function under its
#             namespace URI, past every name above), and evaluation of query TEXT held in a
#             string -- xquery:, function-lookup, load-xquery-module, transform, eval.
#
# NOT scanned: the queries ask.py builds itself (`refs`, `attr`). `q_refs` returns
# document-uri(root($n)) to NAME each hit's file, it addresses every document, and scanning
# it would withdraw the certificate from the tool's most-used negative.
#
# Named residuals (a text scan's limits, not handled): a quote character in a direct element
# constructor's TEXT content (`<r>say 'hi</r>`) can desynchronise the string blanking; a
# user-defined function in a prolog is not followed -- but a prolog already makes the count
