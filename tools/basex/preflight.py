r"""Fail BEFORE the long work, with a message that names the real cause.

WHY THIS EXISTS (every failure below was REPRODUCED, 2026-08-24, not reasoned
about). Nothing checked anything, so the three ways a first run goes wrong all
surfaced as an error blaming the wrong component -- or blaming nothing at all:

  no java on PATH      ask.py -> "error: BaseX query failed: [WinError 2] The
                       system cannot find the file specified"  (rc 2)
                       It blames BaseX for a missing JVM and does not even name
                       the file it could not find. build-corpus.sh is worse: it
                       runs stage.py to completion FIRST (build-corpus.sh:49)
                       and does not touch java until :54, so the whole staging
                       pass is spent before anything can fail.

  no BaseX.jar         "Could not find or load main class org.basex.BaseX"
                       -- accurate for a Java developer, meaningless to a user
                       who has never heard of a classpath.

  DB never built       "Stopped at <abs path>, 1/17: [FODC0002] Resource
                       '<abs path>/x4raw' not found."  (rc 2)
                       The one line that says "run build-corpus.sh" lives on
                       ask.py's ZERO-RESULT path, which an unbuilt DB can never
                       reach. Worst first-run experience in the tool.

THE JAVA FLOOR IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Read out of the shipped jar itself:
`Implementation-Version: 12.4`, `Build-Jdk-Spec: 17`, and `org/basex/BaseX.class`
carries bytecode major **61**. Major 61 IS Java 17 -- an older JVM does not run
it slowly, it refuses to load the class at all. (`Main-Class` is `BaseXGUI`,
which is why every caller uses `java -cp BaseX.jar org.basex.BaseX` and never
`java -jar`.)

Stdlib only, and it deliberately does NOT import x4validate: this must be able
to report "you have no JVM" on a machine where nothing else is configured
either. A diagnostic that needs the world to be healthy cannot diagnose.
