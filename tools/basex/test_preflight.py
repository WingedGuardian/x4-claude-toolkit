r"""The preflight must be able to FAIL, on purpose, for each thing it checks.

A precondition check that has only ever been seen to pass is not verification --
it is a green light nobody has tested the bulb of. Every check here is exercised
in BOTH directions, and the refusal code is asserted to be **2** ("this is not
set up"), never **1**, which throughout this toolkit means "the thing you asked
about has findings". Reporting a missing JVM as 1 tells the reader their corpus
is broken when the truth is that they have no Java.

The failures these tests pin were all REPRODUCED before the module was written
(2026-08-24) -- see preflight.py's own docstring for the verbatim messages the
tool used to emit.

    `.basexhome` is a 0-byte marker shipped in the official BaseX archive. It is
    how BaseX decides that THIS directory is its home. With it, `CREATE DB` writes
    to `<dir>/data`. Without it, BaseX silently relocates its entire home to
    `$HOME/basex` -- proven by running both, same jar, same command:

        jar only            -> $HOME/basex/data/probeA   (queryable, returns 2)
        jar + .basexhome    -> <dir>/data/probeB         (queryable, returns 2)

    Both BUILD fine, which is what makes it dangerous. `_dbpath()` then falls back
    to `<dir>/data`, finds nothing, and reports "the database has not been built"
    over a database that was built and IS queryable. The user's first run becomes:
    run the build (minutes), get told to run the build.
