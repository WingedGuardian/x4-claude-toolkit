r"""Serialize X4's EFFECTIVE merged tree to disk, so BaseX can index what the
engine actually sees — not what somebody wrote.

The two databases answer different questions, and both are wanted
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    x4raw  every file AS WRITTEN, per mod   -> "who WROTE this, in which mod"
    x4eff  _merge.build_effective per vpath -> "what does the ENGINE SEE"

x4raw cannot answer the second: it has no diff application, no load order, no
conflict winner. Ask it "does anything set safepos/@radius to 8km" and it says
yes — from vanilla — while the engine has long since been handed 21km by whoever
loads last. Ask x4eff and you get the value that is actually in play.

Only contested vpaths need building
-----------------------------------
Measured on the live modlist: of 9,138 base+DLC vpaths, only **1,522 are overlaid
by any mod**; another 1,783 mod vpaths are new files. So 3,305 vpaths need a
build_effective call and the remaining 7,616 base documents are already their own
effective form and are symlinked/copied verbatim. At ~0.01 s/vpath that is about
a minute, not the hours a naive "merge everything" would cost.

Usage:  cd tools/x4validate && uv run python ../basex/build-effective.py --out DIR
