"""Tests for ask.py's counting and negative-claim contract.

Run:  cd tools\\basex && python -m pytest test_ask.py -q

No BaseX and no JVM required — `run_xq` is monkeypatched, because what is under
test is the counting and the guard, not XQuery evaluation.

Background (audit 2026-08-01, finding F9): "hits" was `len(output_lines)`, which
is unrelated to the number of matches — 847 occurrences across 4 documents
printed as "32 hit(s)". Worse, the zero-result guard keyed off that same empty
line list, so `count(...)` returning 0 emitted the single line "0", the guard
never ran, and a zero result rendered as "1 hit(s)" with exit 0 — the exact false
positive this tool exists to prevent, reached by its most natural phrasing.
