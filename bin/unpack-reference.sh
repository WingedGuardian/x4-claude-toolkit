# tree was current, so the SessionStart hook announced a stale reference/ at every
# session start and recommended a ~60 GB re-unpack.
#
# check-reference-version.sh was changed to read the SENTINEL first, because that file
# lives INSIDE the tree it describes and therefore cannot drift from it. The v3.1.0
# release reviewer then found the other half: this script wrote the sentinel with a
# bare `touch`, i.e. ZERO BYTES, so there was no build id in it to read and the hook
# fell straight back to the detached file it was written to stop trusting. It worked
# on the developer machine only because that sentinel had been hand-written.
# THE SENTINEL IS A CLAIM THAT THE UNPACK SUCCEEDED, SO COUNT BEFORE WRITING IT.
# It was written unconditionally and the file count was computed AFTERWARDS, for
# display only. So a failed or partial extraction still marked the tree "unpacked
# and locked" -- and the check at the top of this script then REFUSES every later
# attempt, so the tool that produced the broken tree is the one that will not let
# you repair it. Recovery needs a manual `rm` the user has no reason to suspect.
#

# DLC produced 510,711 files on this machine (2026-09-08). 1000 is ~0.2% of that,
