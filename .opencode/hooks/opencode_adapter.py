"""The OpenCode adapter: translate one OpenCode tool call, as the x4guard.js plugin hands it over,
into the toolkit's guard checks, and answer in the ONE shape the plugin accepts. It decides
nothing itself (spec D10): the guards decide, through the Codex adapter's judge/aggregate.

    python opencode_adapter.py <pre|post>      (payload on stdin)

stdin:  {"v":1,"tool":str,"args":object,"directory":str,"shell":"bash"|"powershell"}
stdout: EXACTLY one ASCII line and exit 0:
    X4OK {"v":1,"decision":"allow"|"advise"|"deny","inert":bool,"reason":str|null,"context":str|null}
The plugin throws on anything else, and on "deny".

BEST EFFORT, from OpenCode's docs and source (v1.18.34), NOT measured against a running OpenCode:
  - tool ids (READ tool/shell/id.ts, edit.ts, write.ts, apply_patch.ts): the shell tool is `bash`
    on EVERY OS (args.command, optional args.workdir resolved against the instance directory);
    `edit` / `write` carry args.filePath (relative = against the instance directory);
    `apply_patch` carries args.patchText (the Codex patch envelope).
  - the shell that RUNS a `bash` call is OpenCode's configured shell, else $SHELL, else on
    Windows pwsh/powershell first (READ core/shell.ts). The plugin names it in "shell".
  - OpenCode has no "ask" a plugin can return: a guard's ask is a deny whose reason tells the
    model to ask the user (the Codex rendering, NEEDS YOUR APPROVAL ...).
Routing (pre):
  bash         -> the shell guard (cwd = workdir), plus the patch paths of a shell-run apply_patch
  edit, write  -> a write of filePath
  apply_patch  -> parse_patch_opencode (OpenCode's grammar, not Codex's): add/update/move_to are writes, delete/move_from are deletes
  anything else-> allow, no guard run (read, glob, grep, webfetch, task, skill, MCP tools ...)
On allow/advise the backup hook runs for existing edit/write targets and patch update/delete
ops (Claude Code runs backup-before-edit on Edit/Write). `post` runs the validator hook on each
written path and only ever advises. Stdlib only; Python >= 3.10.
