# X4 AI Assistant Toolkit installer — Linux / macOS / Windows (Git Bash).
# Three install methods, all with fully configurable paths (nothing hardcoded):
#
#   in-game   Copy the toolkit INTO your X4 game folder (the upstream model). One workspace.
#   separate  Keep the toolkit in its OWN folder, pointed at the game via config.
#   global    Install the skills/agents into ~/.claude and write the X4_* paths into your
#             global Claude settings, so they work across MANY mod repos (multi-project).
#
# Every location is auto-detected where possible and overridable by flag/env. The chosen
# paths are written to <toolkit>/x4-paths.env (the single source of truth the hooks, bin/
# scripts and tools read). A 3.x config at <toolkit>/.claude/x4-paths.env is MOVED there.

                     (none found: all, and it says so)
  --unpack          also unpack reference/ now (needs --game + XRCatTool [+wine])

                     32,768-byte budget, so an AGENTS.md of your own lower in the

  --no-env           do NOT set X4_TOOLKIT for your user (by default it is set when
                     unset; a DIFFERENT existing value is reported and left alone)
  --yes              don't prompt; accept detected/blank values (never a

MISSING=""
#: Paths never copied between toolkits, pruned from the destination BOTH before and
#: after the copy. One list, named once: two passes over two hand-written lists is how
#: they drift, and the whole defect here was one of the passes not running.
#: Machine-local paths that must not travel. `.gitignore` is already the correct
#: enumeration of 'must not leave this machine' and nothing derived this from it,
#: so the copy carried 217 files of `.claude/backups/`, every __pycache__ and
#: .pytest_cache under the copy set, and `.perf-baseline.json` -- whose own
#: .gitignore entry says MACHINE-LOCAL by design because wall-clock differs per
#: machine, and which the installer then copied to another machine for
#: perf_guard to compare against a stranger's timings.
X4_COPY_PRUNE="tools/x4validate/.venv tools/x4validate/.pytest_cache tools/basex/.pytest_cache tools/x4validate/.mutation-probe-pristine .claude/hooks/__pycache__ .claude/hooks/.pytest_cache scripts/__pycache__ tools/.pytest_cache tools/basex/__pycache__ tools/basex/basex/.basex tools/x4validate/.perf-baseline.json tools/x4validate/.obtainability-baseline.json tools/x4validate/.claude-md-budget-baseline.json tools/x4validate/.toolkit-usage-baseline.json tools/x4validate/.hook-false-positive-baseline.json tools/x4validate/.instrument-hygiene-baseline.json tools/x4validate/.schema-sweep-baseline.json tools/x4validate/gates/__pycache__ tools/x4validate/scripts/__pycache__ tools/x4validate/tests/__pycache__ tools/x4validate/x4validate/__pycache__"

#: Per-machine files that must NEVER travel from the source: they hold THIS
#: machine paths and secrets, and the destination copy is the user own.
#:
#: Distinct from X4_COPY_PRUNE, and the difference is the whole point: a pruned
#: path is also DELETED from the destination, which is right for a stale .venv and
#: catastrophic for a config. These are skipped on the way IN and left alone on
#: the way OUT.
#:
#: This replaces a backup-then-overwrite-then-restore round trip on the same two
#: files. That round trip had two defects and both are removed rather than fixed:
#: it wrote a file it never intended to change (so `x4lock`, which the README
#: tells users to run, made the whole install fail with a bare `cp: Permission
#: denied` on item 1 of 16), and its restore sat 53 lines after its backup with
#: no trap between them, so any failure in the copy loop skipped the restore and
#: left an orphaned .bak. Not copying a file cannot fail to restore it.
#:
#: The BaseX build products share these semantics exactly -- this machine's, the
#: destination's own, never copied in and NEVER deleted out -- so they live here and
#: not in X4_COPY_PRUNE, whose second meaning is `rm -rf` in the destination. Filed
#: there, an upgrade would erase the user's 2+ GB of built databases, the same
#: dual-meaning trap `.claude/backups` fell into. A checkout accumulates them (release
#: review 2026-09-26: data/ alone was 2.3 GB) and a git source never copies them
#: anyway (see _tracked_copy_set); this is the walk's defence in depth.
X4_KEEP_LOCAL="x4-paths.env .claude/x4-paths.env .claude/settings.local.json .claude/backups .codex/hooks.json .codex/config.toml .opencode/opencode.jsonc tools/basex/basex/data tools/basex/basex/coverage-x4raw.json tools/basex/basex/coverage-x4eff.json tools/basex/_eff tools/basex/stage-manifest.json"

#: THE TRACKED SET, when the source is a git checkout.
#:
#: The two lists above are a hand-kept second copy of `.gitignore`, and they drift:
#: installing from a maintainer checkout carried 33 files git does not track,
#: 2.3 GB of them BaseX databases. `.gitignore` IS the enumeration of what must not
#: leave the machine, so when the source is a work tree the copy set is
#: `git ls-files` -- filtered through the same two lists, so a tracked template
#: still ships and nothing keep-local travels even if someone tracks it.
#:
#: TWO clauses, each with its own falsification twin in the installer suite
#: (and each mutated away separately there, because either one alone shadows the
#: other on the obvious fixtures):
#:   * $SRC is the TOP of its work tree. A toolkit sitting inside SOMEONE ELSE's
#:     repo -- a zip extracted into a game root that is itself a repo -- is
#:     governed by that repo's idea of what is tracked, not the toolkit's.
#:   * the tracked set COVERS every copy item present on disk. A repo that
#:     tracks CLAUDE.md and .claude/ but not tools/ -- the shape of a game-root
#:     repo -- would otherwise install no tools at all, silently. This also
#:     covers `git init` with nothing added.
#: Anything else walks the disk exactly as before -- a release zip holds only tracked
#: files anyway -- and X4_TRACKED_WHY says why, for a source that IS a checkout.
#: Fills X4_TRACKED (relative paths) and X4_TRACKED_ABSENT (tracked but deleted from
#: the working tree); cached, because three callers need it.

#: Strip a trailing path separator, which otherwise makes a STRING comparison lie.
#: `--toolkit "$SRC/"` is not equal to `$SRC`, so the `SRC != TOOLKIT` test said
#: COPY and `cp -r "$SRC/.claude" "$SRC//"` copied a directory into itself. Under
#: `set -e` the script died there, BEFORE the FAILED accounting exists -- so there
#: was no INCOMPLETE banner and no config written, and the exit code was the only
#: sign. MEASURED 2026-09-03 in a sandbox: rc 1, "are the same file", zero config.
#:
#: Both separators, because this runs under Git Bash where a Windows path gets
#: pasted in. A drive root and `/` KEEP their separator: stripping it would turn an
#: absolute path into a relative one. No backslash appears in a case PATTERN here --
#: the first draft had one and the tool boundary collapsed it into a syntax error.
#: Are these the SAME directory? Asked canonically, never as a string.
#:
#: `$SRC` is MSYS-style (`/tmp/...`) because it comes from `cd $(dirname) && pwd`
#: under Git Bash, while `--toolkit` is whatever the user pasted -- and every path
#: this project documents is Windows-style (`C:/...`). So the plain string test
#: compared two spellings of one directory and said COPY. `cp -r` then reported
#: "are the same file" and `set -e` killed the script BEFORE the FAILED accounting
#: exists: no INCOMPLETE banner, no failed: line, no config. MEASURED in a sandbox.
#:
#: `cd ... && pwd -P` settles dialect, trailing separators, . / .. and symlinks at
#: once. A destination that does not exist YET cannot be the source, so a failed cd
#: means "different" -- which is the right answer for a fresh install.

# below was outside the accounting entirely: under `set -e` a failing unpack killed the
# script with NO summary -- neither banner, no `failed:` line, no next steps.
# install.ps1 has used an array with three contributors for a while; this is parity.
# (FAILED and add_failed are defined above the dispatch: the Codex writers inside it
#  record into the same accounting.)

# A BACKSTOP, and today it is UNREACHED -- stated rather than implied. Every
# dispatch arm ends in a writer whose first statement is `refuse_if_dry_run`,
# which exits 0, so control does not arrive here on any path measured (all three
# arms, both installers: this branch printed zero times). It is kept because the
# writers' gate covering these two is an accident of ORDERING rather than a
# property: setup.sh and bin/unpack-reference.sh are invoked at TOP LEVEL,
# outside all three writers, so any future arm not ending in a writer would run
# them under --dry-run. Dead today, correct tomorrow -- and nobody should read it
# as the thing currently doing the work. refuse_if_dry_run's
# own docstring claimed "every write goes through" those three; it does not, and
# these two are the counter-example. A dry run that syncs dependencies or unpacks
# 60 GB of game archives is not a preview.
