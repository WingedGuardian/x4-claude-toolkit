# Shared, cross-platform path/config resolver for the X4 toolkit hooks & scripts.
# SOURCE this (do not execute). Single source of truth for the configurable X4 locations
# so nothing is hardcoded to one OS or one user's folder layout.
#
# Resolution order for each value:  existing env var  >  `x4-paths.env` (see below)  >  default.
#
# WHICH config file (Plan 3 lane I): $X4_CONFIG if set (naming no file reads NONE), else
# <toolkit>/x4-paths.env, else the 3.x <toolkit>/.claude/x4-paths.env (deprecated, still
# read for all of 4.x). The same rule as `_paths._locate_config()`, pinned to it by
# tools/x4validate/tests/test_config_precedence_agrees.py.
#
# THE ENVIRONMENT WINS, matching CLAUDE.md ("env var > x4-paths.env > default") and
# the Python half (`_paths._layers()` returns [env, file, fallback]).
#
# It did not, until 2026-09-03. install.sh writes bare KEY="value" lines and this
# file sourced them with `set -a`, so a plain assignment overwrote whatever had been
# exported -- and the note here was rewritten to match that rather than to fix it.
# A comment corrected to agree with a defect is not a decision.
#
# The divergence was the dangerous half: both halves resolve paths for the SAME
# machine, so exporting X4_GAME pointed x4validate at one install while the guards
# protecting the game folder read another. Protection and work aimed at different
# trees, silently.
# All locations are overridable; see x4-paths.env.example (toolkit root) for the keys.

# Toolkit root (where this toolkit lives).
# Prefer $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR; otherwise derive it from the hook's OWN location
# (<toolkit>/.claude/hooks/ -> <toolkit>), because falling back to $(pwd) makes every
# path resolve against whatever directory the shell happened to be in — which silently
# scattered auto-backups outside the toolkit whenever the var was unset.
# WAS IT REALLY IN THE ENVIRONMENT? The block below DERIVES a value when it is not,
# and the snapshot/restore further down exists so a real environment variable outranks
# the config file. A derived fallback is not an environment variable -- but it is
# indistinguishable from one by the time the snapshot is taken, so the config file's
# own X4_TOOLKIT was ALWAYS discarded.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-05 with a config saying X4_TOOLKIT=<tkA> and no X4_* exported:
#     python  _paths.reference()  ->  <tkA>/reference   (honours the file)
#     bash    X4_REFERENCE        ->  <tkB>/reference   (ignored it)
# and a Write into <tkA>/reference was a SILENT ALLOW past the reference/ HARD BLOCK,
# while <tkB>/reference denied. X4_TOOLKIT is the key every other path derives from,
# and install.sh writes it into that file on every method -- so the guards were reading
# a different tree from the validator. That is the exact split this file's header says
# it exists to prevent.

# --- the path config is DATA, never code (v4.0 release review R1-F1 / R1-P1) -------------
# ONE grammar, the same as `_paths.parse_env_report` (tests/test_config_precedence_agrees.py
# runs both over the same files):
#   * blank lines and `#` lines are skipped; a trailing CR (CRLF file) and a leading UTF-8
#     BOM are dropped from every line, for every key;
#   * `[export ]KEY=value`, KEY = X4_[A-Z0-9_]+ or XRCATTOOL, blanks around `=` allowed;
#   * the value: '...' is literal; "..." honours \\ \" \$ \` and expands $NAME / ${NAME}
#     (NAME = [A-Z0-9_]+); unquoted text expands too, keeps backslashes, and ends at a ` #`
#     comment; adjacent segments concatenate; an unterminated quote falls back to the whole
#     value with its outer quotes stripped (`_paths._unquote_legacy`);
#   * $NAME is the file's own earlier value, else the shell's; an unknown name is empty.
#     That is a STRING substitution: nothing is ever run.
# A line that does not fit is IGNORED and recorded in `_x4_cfg_ignored` as LINE:REASON --
#   shape (not KEY=value: `exit 0`, `source x`), key (not an X4 key: PATH=, JQ=),
#   subst ($( ) or a backtick), operator (an unquoted ; & | < >), guard (X4_GUARD or
#   X4_GUARD_CHECK: the guards are switched off only by the LAUNCH environment, never by a
#   file an agent could write).
# Line numbers and reasons only, never a value: the file may hold X4_NEXUS_KEY.
# An EMPTY value configures nothing. An exported (non-empty) value always wins -- for EVERY
# key, as in Python's `_layers()`; the sourcing loader protected only a named twelve -- except
# a DERIVED X4_TOOLKIT, which the file may replace (see _X4_TK_FROM_ENV above).
# No subshell and no process anywhere below: this runs on every hook call (HK-4).
#: ASCII name characters, spelled out: a bracket RANGE such as [A-Z] follows the locale's
#: collation in a bash pattern and can admit lowercase letters.

# --- path helpers: case-insensitive + backslash-insensitive (Windows/Git-Bash/macOS/Linux) ---
# x4_norm PATH_OR_COMMAND -> lowercase, backslashes to slashes, and the DRIVE DIALECT
# unified. MEASURED 2026-08-30: without the last step, Git Bash's "/c/Users/..." and
# Windows' "C:/Users/..." never compare equal, so any guard rooted purely on a
# configured PATH missed one of the two dialects -- the same Documents write asked in
# one form and was ALLOWED in the other. 2,553 historical commands use the MSYS form,
# and no probe in the suite had ever used a drive-lettered root, so nothing could have
# caught it. Rules carrying a NAME backstop (the game, the profile) were unaffected.
#
# Windows-to-MSYS is the safe direction: "c:/" is unambiguous, since a colon is illegal
# elsewhere in a Windows path, whereas "/c/" also occurs mid-path. The guard on the
# preceding character is what keeps "https://" from matching as a drive named "s".
#
# ONE subprocess, not two: sed's `y` transliterates, which is all `tr` was doing. This
# helper is the hot path of protect-files.sh -- MEASURED 2026-08-31 at 145 ms per call
# and ~22 calls per Edit/Write, i.e. ~6 s on every file edit, because x4_under
# canonicalises BOTH of its arguments on all 11 of its call sites. Process spawn is the
# whole cost on Windows; halving the spawns halves the bill.
#
# Behaviour is UNCHANGED and that was proven, not assumed: 43 of 43 path shapes agree
# with the two-process form, including the live configured roots, and the differential
# harness was shown able to detect a deliberately-wrong implementation. x4_norm is shared
# by every guard, and F93 is the entry about a shared helper quietly re-scoping the rules
# above it -- so this may cost less, and must not decide differently.
x4_norm() {
  # Lowercase, backslash -> slash, drive dialect unified, repeated separators
  # collapsed, THEN dot segments resolved.
  #
  # The separator pass is the twin of the dot pass below and was added for the same
  # reason: `<root>//reference/x` names the same file as `<root>/reference/x` on
  # both POSIX and Windows, but compared equal to nothing and walked past the
  # reference/ HARD BLOCK. MEASURED 2026-09-03 in BOTH channels. A LEADING `//`
  # survives -- that is a UNC share, a different location -- which is what the
  # `(.)` guard in the rule is for.
  #
  # The dot-segment pass is not cosmetic. x4_canon only feeds POSIX-absolute paths to
  # realpath, so a WINDOWS-dialect path kept its `..` and compared unequal to the root:
  # MEASURED 2026-09-01, C:/<toolkit>/other/../reference/libraries/w.xml was NOT under
  # reference/, and protect-files.sh returned EMPTY -- a silent allow past a HARD BLOCK
  # -- while the identical /c/... form was correctly caught. hook_facts.norm() has
  # always collapsed them (posixpath.normpath); this is the same rule on the bash side,
  # so two implementations of one path fact stop disagreeing.
  #
  # Still ONE subprocess: the loops live inside the same sed program.
  #
  # The EXTENDED-LENGTH prefix goes first, and the order is the fix rather than a
  # detail. Windows accepts \\?\C:\... (and the \\.\ device form) for any path, the
  # Write tool passes it through, and Python opens it -- but it normalises to
  # //?/c:/... which is under no configured root, so the reference HARD BLOCK simply
  # did not fire. Stripping it AFTER the drive-dialect rule below would not help:
  # that rule rewrites <sep>c:/ to <sep>/c/, turning //?/c:/users into //?//c/users,
  # which still matches nothing.
  #
  # \\?\UNC\server\share is the same prefix over a network path and unwraps to
  # //server/share.
  #
  # WINDOWS ALIASES (FX-G2 item 3), the three lines after `tslash`: per component, an NTFS
  # stream suffix is dropped (`x::$DATA` and `x:alt` are x, `dir::$INDEX_ALLOCATION` is dir)
  # and so are trailing dots and spaces (`reference./` is reference). MEASURED 2026-10-05:
  # Python wrote INTO x4-paths.env through `x4-paths.env.`, `x4-paths.env ` and

# preview. No error, exit code unchanged -- the failure is indistinguishable
# from success, which is the whole reason this exists. Four arms per channel,

#
#   bare stdout        500 BOTH · 10,000 BOTH · 10,001 HEAD · 30,000 HEAD

# still arrived whole. So the cap is on the CONTENT the model receives and the
# JSON envelope does NOT count -- budget the reason at 10,000 flat, never
# "10,000 minus envelope".
#
# ⚠ THE NUMBER MOVES BETWEEN CC VERSIONS (high-20s K on 2.1.218 -> 10,000 on
# 2.1.246 -> still 10,000 on 2.1.263). Re-derive it on a CC bump with the probe
# above, keeping a small-size control arm so a broken probe cannot read as a
# clean pass. This is the ONLY place the number is written down; a second copy
# would drift, and a wrong constant here fails silently in the safe-looking
# direction.

# ONE bound, applied BEFORE either renderer runs. Doing it inside jq and again
