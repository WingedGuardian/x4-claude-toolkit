r"""Locate a REAL bash on Windows, never the WSL stub -- by asking the GUARDS' resolver.

`shutil.which("bash")` on Windows returns `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe` -- the WSL
launcher -- whenever Git Bash is not on PATH, which is the normal state in PowerShell
and in CI. That stub either fails outright or runs a Linux bash in a filesystem where
`C:/Users/...` does not exist, so every path-shaped assertion silently changes meaning.

MEASURED 2026-09-01 from PowerShell on this machine:
    shutil.which("bash")     -> C:\Windows\system32\bash.EXE
    shutil.which("bash.exe") -> C:\Windows\system32\bash.exe
The second is the important one: `scripts/fuzz-guard.py` carried
`which("bash.exe") or which("bash")` with a comment saying it avoided the WSL stub.
It did not -- the stub IS named bash.exe. A defence that names the right threat and
does not stop it is worse than none, because it stops anyone looking again.

ONE RESOLVER (B1, install red-team 2026-10-04). This module used to carry its own list of
Git for Windows locations while the guards' `x4guard.resolve_bash()` asked only PATH -- so on
a stock machine the tools found Git Bash and the guards (and the OpenCode renderer, and
x4doctor's rows) did not. The algorithm now lives in ONE place, `x4guard.resolve_bash()`,
because a deployed guard copy has no scripts/ to import from; this module loads the toolkit's
own guard copy and asks it.
