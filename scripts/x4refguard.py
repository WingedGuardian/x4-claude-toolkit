r"""Layer 2 for `reference/`: an OS-level protection that holds against EVERY process,
hooks or no hooks -- and that reports each state as itself, never as "protected" by default.

WHY. `reference/` is the unpacked base game + DLC: ~510,000 files, a 27 GB re-unpack to
replace. Until this tool its only protection was the `.unpacked-and-locked` sentinel
(which the toolkit's own scripts respect) and the Claude hooks (which see only commands
Claude types). An interpreter write -- `python -c "open(p, 'w')"` -- passed both.

WHAT IT APPLIES

  Windows   one inherited deny ACE on the root, for the CURRENT USER'S SID:
                icacls <root> /deny *<SID>:(OI)(CI)(DE,DC,WD,AD)
            = Delete + DeleteSubdirectoriesAndFiles + WriteData + AppendData
            = numeric mask 65606 (EXPECTED_MASK). Never W, S, WDAC, WO or F: `W` carries
            SYNCHRONIZE and denied READS; WDAC made an earlier deny unremovable (see
            x4lock.py, "WHY THERE IS NO ACL HERE").
            MEASURED 2026-10-02 on scratch trees (docs/superpowers/measurements):
            reads 12/12 still work; writes 20/20 and deletes/renames 15/15 blocked;
            removable by the same unelevated user 47/47 with 0 deny entries left;
            ~8 s per 100k files to apply or remove; mtime/size unchanged 100k/100k.
  Linux     BEST EFFORT, NOT DEVICE-TESTED. As root with `chattr`: `chattr -R +i`
            (immutable). Otherwise: `chmod a-w` on every directory and file -- a
            directory without write permission refuses unlink/rename/create inside it,
            a file without it refuses an overwrite.
  macOS     BEST EFFORT, NOT DEVICE-TESTED. `chflags -R uchg` (owner-settable
            immutable flag), else the same chmod fallback.
  other     exit 3 `unsupported` -- the ONLY case that exit 3 means.

`status` names the mechanism found, what it stops, and what it does NOT stop. It never
reports a layer it could not confirm by re-reading the filesystem.

WHAT IT DOES NOT STOP (the honest gaps)
  * Renaming the reference ROOT itself: the PARENT directory grants that (MEASURED on
    Windows; INFERRED on POSIX for chmod). `status` then reports the configured root
    missing, never "protected".
  * The same user deliberately lifting it -- `remove` below, or the raw commands in the
    escape hatch. This stops ACCIDENTS, not intent. Agent harnesses gate `remove` (a
    Claude `ask`, a Codex `.rules` prompt).
  * Windows: an Administrator; changing ACLs/attributes (WRITE_DAC is deliberately not
    denied, so the deny stays removable). POSIX chmod: root, and `chmod u+w` by the owner.

USAGE
    python scripts/x4refguard.py status [--json] [--full] [--toolkit DIR] [--reference DIR]
    python scripts/x4refguard.py apply  [--path P] [--yes] [--toolkit DIR] [--reference DIR]   P must be the configured root
    python scripts/x4refguard.py remove [--path P] [--yes] [--toolkit DIR] [--reference DIR]   the escape hatch, step 1/2

BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING (B3, install red-team 2026-10-04: an apply ran >2 minutes on a
60 GB tree with no output and no question): apply and remove print the target root and
count the objects under it (a progress line every 50,000), then ASK. `--yes` answers for
you; without it and without a terminal to ask on, they refuse with exit 2. While the OS
call runs, a heartbeat line says it is still working.

WHICH TOOLKIT (B2, same red-team): this script acts for the toolkit it LIVES IN. If
$X4_TOOLKIT names a different one, one line says so, and apply/remove REFUSE (exit 2)
unless --toolkit DIR names the toolkit to act for explicitly. And an EXPORTED X4_REFERENCE
naming a different root from the acting toolkit's config makes apply/remove REFUSE (exit 2),
printing both roots, unless --reference DIR chooses one (FX-B2: `--toolkit B` alone still
acted on another copy's tree through an inherited X4_REFERENCE); status prints one line.

`status` samples: the root, the sentinel, and the first file found depth-first in each
top-level directory -- NOT a census, and it says so on every run. `--full` walks every
object (slow on Windows: one Get-Acl per object) and says how many it walked.

EXIT CODES (the toolkit's contract)
    0  protected, or the action succeeded AND was verified by re-reading
    1  absent or partial, or the action ran but verification disagrees
    2  unconfigured, refused, or the state could not be read
    3  unsupported platform (no mechanism exists here)

ESCAPE HATCH -- how a USER lifts it (never an agent on its own):
    1. python scripts/x4refguard.py remove
    2. if the configured root has changed since:  ... remove --path <old root>
       (accepted only if that path carries THIS tool's exact protection)
    3. if this tool is broken, Windows, from cmd.exe:
           icacls "<root>" /remove:d *<your SID>      (`whoami /user` prints the SID)
       Linux: sudo chattr -R -i "<root>"  /  chmod -R u+w "<root>"
       macOS: chflags -R nouchg "<root>"  /  chmod -R u+w "<root>"
    4. last resort, Windows, elevated:  icacls "<root>" /reset /T /C
       (discards every explicit ACE in the tree and restores inheritance)

TEST SAFETY. When `X4_REFGUARD_SANDBOX` is set, every mutating call (icacls, chattr,
chflags, chmod) first asserts its target is strictly under that directory and raises
SandboxViolation -- deliberately not an Exception subclass, so nothing swallows it --
otherwise. The test suites set it to their tmp dir.
