"""Make the irreplaceable files unwritable by accident, and say so honestly.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Four times in twelve days this workspace's own tooling destroyed a
live, irreplaceable file: a memory file and a 375-line module truncated to 0 bytes by
text-mode writes that raised mid-encode, the game-root CLAUDE.md and KNOWLEDGEBASE.md
overwritten by a reviewer's installer probe, and a 258-entry mod registry replaced by a
46-byte fresh one. None was a decision. Each was a command that ran, resolved to a live
path, and met nothing in the way.

Prose did not stop any of them -- 150 KB of instructions were in context every time. The
two locations on this machine that have a MECHANISM have never been lost: `reference/`
(a sentinel the tools refuse past) and the user profile (git plus a confirming hook).
This gives the rest of the irreplaceable set protection at the only layer that can see a
write from inside another process: the filesystem.

WHAT STOPS A WRITE (measured here, Windows 11, 14 primitives, each with a control
proving the same primitive DOES change the file when it is unlocked):

    primitive                                     read-only attribute
    python open("w") / write_text / write_bytes   blocked
    python os.truncate / os.replace               blocked   (os.replace: WINDOWS ONLY)
    python shutil.copy2 / os.remove               blocked   (os.remove:  WINDOWS ONLY)
    bash > / cp / tee                             blocked
    pwsh Set-Content                              blocked
    bash rm -f                                    NOT blocked
    pwsh Copy-Item -Force / Remove-Item -Force    NOT blocked

11 of 14 ON WINDOWS. The three that get through are DELETES and force-overwrites:
POSIX `unlink` is authorised by write permission on the DIRECTORY, not the file, and
`-Force` clears the attribute before writing.

WARNING: ON LINUX/macOS IT IS 9 OF 14. `os.remove` IS unlink and `os.replace` IS
rename-over, so the directory-permission rule stated above for `rm -f` applies to BOTH
python primitives too -- this table listed them as blocked because it was measured on
Windows, where the read-only attribute does deny both. MEASURED on CI (ubuntu, run
33994180317): `test_a_locked_file_survives[os_remove]` and `[os_replace]` DID NOT RAISE.
The test now pins the weaker POSIX guarantee instead of skipping it, so the two rows
above cannot drift back to "universal" unnoticed. Those are covered a layer up -- the Bash guard asks
before a delete inside an X4 directory, and `x4canary` notices a file that shrank.

The number that decided the design: ALL FOUR real incidents are in the blocked set.
Every one was a python text write or an installer's `cp`; not one was `rm -f` or
`-Force`. This stops what has actually happened, not what is imaginable.

⚠ An earlier version of this table said `rm -f` was blocked. It was measured with the
`bash` on Windows PATH, which is the WSL stub: it cannot open a `C:/...` path, so its
failure READ AS the lock working. Always pair such a probe with a control on an
unlocked file -- the control is what turned that row from a pass into a non-answer.

WHY THERE IS NO ACL HERE, THOUGH AN ACL WOULD CLOSE THAT GAP. The first version of this
tool also applied `icacls /deny <user>:(W,D,WDAC,WO)`, which does block `-Force`. It was
withdrawn after it locked this machine out of two of its own files:

  * `W` in icacls shorthand is FILE_GENERIC_WRITE, which INCLUDES SYNCHRONIZE. Every
    synchronous open needs SYNCHRONIZE, so a "write deny" denies READING as well. The
    files became completely inaccessible, one of them a hook that runs on every edit.
  * The deny includes WDAC, so it removes the permission needed to remove itself. On a
    file owned by BUILTIN\\Administrators rather than the user -- which is ordinary under
    Program Files -- `icacls /remove:d`, `Set-Acl`, `takeown` and even rename all fail
    unelevated. Repair required an administrator.

A protection whose failure mode is "you can no longer read your own file, and cannot
undo it without elevation" is worse than the accident it prevents. The read-only bit
cannot deny a read, cannot be un-removable, and works the same on every platform.

The lock is meant to stop an ACCIDENT, not a determined process. Any code that really
means it can clear the bit -- but it has to MEAN it, in a separate visible step, which
is exactly what none of the four incidents did.

USAGE
    python scripts/x4lock.py status            what is protected, and is it locked
    python scripts/x4lock.py lock              lock every file in the manifest
    python scripts/x4lock.py unlock <path>     unlock ONE file (the choke point)
    python scripts/x4lock.py unlock --all      unlock everything
    python scripts/x4lock.py protected <path>  exit 0 if it is in the manifest (for the guards)

    Every subcommand takes --toolkit DIR. Default: the toolkit this script LIVES IN (B2,
    install red-team 2026-10-04); lock/unlock REFUSE (exit 2) while $X4_TOOLKIT names a
    different toolkit unless --toolkit is given -- and while an exported X4_GAME/X4_MODS/...
    names a different root from that toolkit's config, unless --game / --registry chooses one
    (FX-B2). Both roots are printed.

The manifest is derived from the configured roots, never hard-coded to one machine, and
is extended by `X4_PROTECTED` (an os.pathsep-separated list) for anything site-specific.
