"""Prove the hook tests can FAIL, and that every guard rule is probed in both directions.

    python scripts/verify-hook-tests.py

`test_hook_facts.py` passing tells you the code agrees with the tests. It does not tell
you the tests could ever have disagreed. This repository has shipped several guards that
were inert for entire releases while their suite was green, so a green result is only
evidence once the red result is reachable (CLAUDE.md "if you cannot make a check fail on
purpose, you have not verified anything").

Two passes, both on a COPY of the hooks -- never the working tree. A mutation gate that
edits real files makes them deliberately wrong for the duration, and a release port once
read a mutated file and shipped it.

  MUTATION  plant one specific defect; the NAMED test for it must go red. Requiring a
            named test, not merely "something failed", is what stops a mutation that
            breaks the import from counting as coverage for anything.

  COVERAGE  pin each predicate false -- a must-FIRE test must break; pin it true -- a
            must-NOT-fire test must break. This is how "every rule is probed both ways"
            becomes a measurement instead of a claim about the test file.

Exit 0 if both pass, 1 if either finds a hole, 2 if the baseline is not green (in which
case neither result means anything and no verdict is given).
