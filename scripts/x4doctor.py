"""x4doctor -- are this root's guards LIVE, per agent target? Read-only.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every way the guards have failed here looked, from outside, exactly like a
guarded install: a hook that read zero bytes of stdin and exited 0; `bash` resolving to the
WSL stub, which cannot run a Windows-path script; a Store `python` stub that resolves and
then cannot run; Codex skipping a hook it has not reviewed, SILENTLY (MEASURED 2026-09-30).
None of those says anything. This command asks, per installed agent target:

  * toolchain  -- the bash, python and jq the GUARDS resolve, asked of the guards' own
                  resolver (never re-implemented: a parallel resolver answers an adjacent
                  question), and EXECUTED, because resolving is not running;
  * roots      -- the reference/game roots the guards see vs the ones the tools see;
  * parity     -- the deployed tree against the toolkit source (gates/deploy_parity.py);
  * self-test  -- `x4guard.py check` controls that MUST deny and controls that MUST allow,
                  so a guard that denies everything cannot read as healthy;
  * liveness   -- Claude's hook wiring; Codex's project trust and per-hook review state;
                  X4_GUARD; the OS-level reference protection; the x4lock state.

THE CONTRACT -- ABSENCE vs NON-ANSWER, structurally:
  every row is OK, FAIL, UNKNOWN, TODO or N/A. N/A means only "this target is not installed
  here" (or "this check cannot apply on this OS"). TODO means "correctly installed; YOUR
  step is pending" -- trusting the folder in Codex, approving its hooks, applying the OS
  protection of reference/: things the installer must never do for you (C2, install
  red-team 2026-10-04: a correct fresh install exited 1 on those alone). A check that
  RAISES becomes UNKNOWN with the exception named, never a dropped row.

    exit 0  every applicable check is OK, and at least one answered
    exit 1  any FAIL                             (a TODO never hides one)
    exit 3  no FAIL, but at least one UNKNOWN   (x4validate's degraded exit)
    exit 4  no FAIL, no UNKNOWN: only YOUR steps (TODO rows) are pending
    exit 2  could not run: no agent target at --root, nothing answered, or a usage error

The verdict line is printed FIRST (CLAUDE.md #38: a truncated report keeps its head).

It executes nothing it judges: the guard self-test goes through `x4guard.py check`, which
is side-effect-free, against a probe path that does not exist. It writes no file and never
touches Codex's config. Stdlib only, Python >= 3.10, so a broken uv or venv cannot take
down the tool that diagnoses it.

USAGE
    python scripts/x4doctor.py [--root DIR] [--agent claude|codex|generic|opencode] [--json] [--toolkit DIR]

OPENCODE (Plan 3 lane L) is BEST EFFORT, from OpenCode's docs and source, not measured: its
rows say whether the toolkit's two layers are IN PLACE (plugin + adapter, rendered deny
rules), never that OpenCode loaded them -- only the `X4 GUARDS LIVE` line in an OpenCode
session shows that. The OpenCode desktop app is not supported (anomalyco/opencode#38604).
