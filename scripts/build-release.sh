# Build the release asset, and PROVE it is the tag.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. v3.0.0 shipped `X4.Foundations.Claude.Code.Toolkit.v3.0.0.zip`
# (6,508,551 bytes) and NOTHING IN THE REPO MADE IT. The bundle a user downloads was
# assembled by hand, so it could not be reproduced, could not be diffed against the
# tag, and had no check that its contents were the reviewed contents.
#
# That is not a hypothetical worry in this repo. A release port once ran while a
# MUTATING gate had `_merge.py` rewritten in place and carried `if len(targets) >
# 99999:` into the public bundle -- ambiguous-selector detection silently OFF in a
# shipped release, with the port reporting success and the tracked diff looking right
# (CLAUDE.md #27). A bundle built from the WORKING TREE is exactly where that recurs.
#
# So this builds from `git archive`, which reads the COMMITTED object store and cannot
# see a working-tree edit at all -- immune to that window by construction rather than
# by remembering.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-07: `git archive --format=zip v3.0.0` reproduces the shipped v3.0.0
# asset BYTE FOR BYTE -- 6,508,551 bytes, sha256
# 273d242c168b4cff5d0679a9251c9e230506c540fd22ff5c39f66edd03fd4de6, all 258 members
# identical. So this script is not a new convention; it is the existing one, written
# down and checked. `--selftest` re-proves that claim, which is what makes the build
# method falsifiable instead of merely asserted.

# question that would exclude nothing and refuse everything. Ancestors are queried
# too, in the trailing-slash form the directory pattern actually matches.
#
# `--source=<ref>` reads the attributes AS OF THE REF -- what git archive used. The
# working tree's .gitattributes may legitimately differ, and does whenever an older
# tag is verified (v3.0.0 predates this very rule). If git is too old for --source,
