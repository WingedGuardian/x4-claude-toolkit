"""One parse pass over a Bash hook payload, answering every guard rule's question.

protect-bash.sh keeps the POLICY -- which verdict, and the prose explaining it. This
module supplies the FACTS. That split exists because the previous design had each of
eight rules hand-roll its own quote-aware shell parsing in bash, and:

  * MEASURED 2026-08-31, clean machine, 201-char command: 13,585 ms per Bash call,
    against 1,205 ms before the rules were re-scoped -- 11.3x. PreToolUse blocks the
    tool call, so that is pure latency on every command. Attributed by profiling:
    resolve_var cost 236 ms for ONE token and was called per-token inside per-segment
    loops; writes_under and searches_rooted_at were re-invoked 5 and 4 times, each
    re-tokenising from scratch.
  * Every gap a code review found lived in that duplicated parsing -- `mv -t`, `>|`,
    wrapper verbs (time/nice/env/sudo/xargs), `grep -r -e`, rg being recursive by
    default, and a heredoc marker inside a quoted string opening a skip region.

Fixing those one predicate at a time meant writing the same parser eight more times.
This is the "one implementation, asked for by everyone else" rule from CLAUDE.md's
narrowing-step table, applied to the guards themselves.

Pure functions throughout: no filesystem, no environment, no subprocesses -- with ONE
deliberate exception. PowerShell text (the PowerShell TOOL's payload, or a
`powershell -c` / `pwsh -Command` nested in a Bash command) is parsed by PowerShell's
own parser: `powershell_to_sh` hands it to ps_translate.ps1, which answers "what does
this do to the filesystem" as an equivalent POSIX-shell command, and that command then
goes through the SAME pass as any other -- one rule set, two front-ends
(AUDIT-2026-09-24 HK-1). The subprocess runs only when PowerShell text is present.
Everything here is unit-tested directly in test_hook_facts.py.

#: the inert spelling a review reported it as. `/./x` is a legitimate POSIX path

#: Shell RESERVED WORDS that can stand immediately before a simple command inside one
#: `;`-delimited segment. MEASURED 2026-09-01 by the syntax-class fuzzer: because the
#: splitter cuts on `;` and `&&`, `if true; then rm -rf <game>; fi` yields the segment
#: `then rm -rf <game>`, whose verb() is `then` -- so EVERY verb-keyed rule missed and
#: the hook fell silent. 90 bypasses over 10 compound forms x 9 seeds, including the
#: three HARD BLOCKS (game root, extensions wholesale, reference tree). The 10th seed
#: was immune because it is redirect-keyed, not verb-keyed, which is what pins the
#: root cause: the operand was always there, the VERB was the keyword.
#:
#: `time`/`nice`/`sudo` are handled separately by WRAPPERS in verb(); this set exists
#: because the keyword has to leave the SEGMENT before any rule looks at it, so that
#: one fix serves every rule instead of each rule learning the grammar.
RESERVED = {"if", "then", "else", "elif", "fi", "do", "done", "while", "until",
            "case", "esac", "in", "for", "select", "function", "!", "{", "}", "coproc", "[[", "]]"}

#: The `in` of `case WORD in`. A TOKEN, not the substring: see the block in
#: strip_compound_prefix() for the bypass that shape caused.
_CASE_IN = re.compile(r"\s+in(?:\s|$)")

#: A `case` ARM LABEL, and nothing else. The label is a single glob token --
#: `x)`, `*)`, `*.txt)`, `a|b)`, `"a")` -- so it carries NO WHITESPACE, and THAT is
#: what makes this safe: every dangerous rule needs an OPERAND, an operand needs a
#: space, so a spaceless label can never hide one.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-01, and it is why whitespace must stay excluded: the first
#: version was `^[^()|&;]*\)\s`, whose class allowed SPACES, so it also matched the
#: tail of a PROCESS SUBSTITUTION -- `diff <(cd "$GAME" && rm -rf extensions) <(echo b)`
#: splits to `rm -rf extensions)`, the whole thing was eaten as a "label", and the
#: delete went silent. A fix for one bypass that opens another is worse than the bug,
#: and only the corpus diff -- 20 commands with a paren-suffixed verb -- surfaced it.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-04: three MORE legal spellings walked past this, each a total
#: bypass of every hard block, found only once the fuzzer was taught to vary its
#: template PARAMETERS (it had always emitted `case x in x)`):
#:   `case $x in *)rm ...`    -- no space after `)`, so the old trailing `\s` missed it
#:   `case $x in (*) rm ...`  -- the POSIX `(pattern)` arm; `(` was excluded outright
#:   `case $x in "a") rm ...` -- a quoted label; the guard rejected ANY quoted char
#: The trailing `\s` was never the safety property -- the no-whitespace CLASS is --
#: so dropping it costs nothing. `rm -rf extensions)` still cannot match: `[^\s()&;]+`
#: stops at the first space, long before the `)`.
_CASE_ARM = re.compile(r"^\(?[^\s()&;]+\)")

#: A function DEFINITION header is not a reserved word, so it survived the first
#: version of this and `f() { rm -rf <game>; }; f` stayed blind while the other nine
#: compound forms were fixed. Both spellings: `f() {` and `function f {`.

#: A heredoc OPENER's delimiter. Three spellings, because the delimiter is a WORD,
#: not an identifier: single-quoted, double-quoted, or bare.
#:
#: MEASURED 2026-09-04: the old pattern was `[\"']?([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)[\"']?`,
#: which TRUNCATES the marker at the first character an identifier cannot contain.
#: `<<'E-O-F'` yielded `E`, `<<'EOF.md'` yielded `EOF`, and `<<"my marker"` yielded
#: `my`. The terminator line then never compares equal, so strip_heredocs' skip
#: region runs to END OF INPUT -- and everything after the heredoc reaches NO RULE
#: AT ALL. Not just the path rules: `git add -A` and the profile-name search went
#: blind too. Found by teaching the fuzzer to vary its template PARAMETERS; 996
#: mutants had never emitted a non-identifier marker.
#:
#: Direction is one-way. The old form MISSED markers, so its skip region was too
#: LONG and hid commands; matching them correctly can only reveal more commands to
#: the rules, never fewer.
#: A heredoc delimiter WORD. Bash applies QUOTE REMOVAL to it, so `EOF`,
#: `'EOF'`, `"EOF"`, `\\EOF` and `E'OF'` all terminate at EOF -- the word is
#: assembled from quoted runs, escaped characters and plain characters, and
#: dequoted by `_dequote_marker` below.
#:
#: B1, MEASURED 2026-09-06: the previous form had three fixed spellings and a
#: bare alternative whose class ALLOWED a backslash and a quote, so `<<\\EOF`
#: captured `\\EOF` and `<<E'OF'` captured `E'OF'`. Neither matches the real
#: terminator, `strip_heredocs` compares the body line verbatim, and the skip
#: region therefore ran to END OF INPUT -- deleting every following command
#: from `body` before a single rule could read it. Three HARD BLOCKS included.

#: installed and a syntax it does not even parse (nested f-strings) -- so it fails
#: with ModuleNotFoundError or SyntaxError, which reads exactly like a genuine test

#: DIFFERS from instrument_hygiene's own regex in several MEASURED respects,
#: stated rather than left to be discovered:
#:   * SEGMENT- AND VERB-SCOPED, not pure text: instrument_hygiene's pattern is
#:     "no `uv run` ANYWHERE earlier in the command". This predicate uses the
#:     same discipline every other rule in this file uses, so a `uv run`
#:     mentioned in an unrelated earlier segment, a comment, or a quoted string
#:     cannot immunise (or fake-trigger) a real bare invocation.
#:   * WIDER on the INTERPRETER and the SHAPE: `py` counts too (instrument_hygiene
#:     names only `python3?`), and it is not limited to `-m pytest` -- `-m
#:     x4validate` and a script path under toolkit code count too.
#:   * NARROWER on WHAT COUNTS AS "toolkit code" than CLAUDE.md's own routing
#:     table wording ("tools/, scripts/, gates/, .claude/hooks/") -- see
#:     `_PROJECT_DIR` below for the measurement that cut it down to
#:     `tools/x4validate/` + `gates/`. Classifying every historical hit (not a
#:     sample) found the wider wording flagged files that genuinely run fine
#:     under this machine's real bare Python 3.10: `.claude/hooks/*.py` is
#:     invoked bare BY THE HOOK INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF, and the toolkit-root
#:     `scripts/*.py` files (x4lock.py, x4canary.py, scan-identifiers.py, ...)
#:     import stdlib only. A rule is not "viable as a PreToolUse rule" (this
#:     gate's own words) if a third of its fires are advice against something
#:     that already works.
#: `python2`/`pypy`/`pypy3` (unlike `_PYTHONS` above) are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED:
