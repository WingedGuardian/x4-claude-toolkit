"""Unit tests for hook_facts.py -- the single parse pass behind protect-bash.sh.

Runnable with no dependencies:  python .claude/hooks/test_hook_facts.py

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Eight guard rules each hand-rolled quote-aware shell parsing in
bash. MEASURED 2026-08-31 on a clean machine: that cost 13,585 ms per Bash call on a
201-char command, against 1,205 ms before the rules were re-scoped -- 11.3x -- because
resolve_var re-derived its assignment table per TOKEN inside per-SEGMENT loops, and
writes_under / searches_rooted_at were each re-invoked 5 and 4 times with no memoising.
Every remaining gap the code review found also lived in that duplicated parsing.

Dangerous tokens are BUILT FROM PARTS. A literal here is read by the live hook when
this file is written, and a guard blocking the work of fixing guards has already
happened four times.

def load_tests(loader, standard_tests, pattern):

    `def test_*` in this file was invisible to it.

    MEASURED by the v3.1.0 release reviewer: the runner CI uses
    (`python .claude/hooks/test_hook_facts.py`, ci.yml:122) reported **403 tests, OK**
    while pytest reported **433**. The 30 in the gap were added by this arc and are the
    tests for its headline work -- the resolve() size ceiling, the ANSI-C hex/octal
    bypass, and four hard-block bypasses. Reverting the wrapper-value fix left CI
    printing "Ran 403 tests ... OK" while pytest named the four failures.

    `verify-hook-tests.py` drives the same runner, so its "baseline: 403 tests green"
    and its 0-of-82 mutation result were computed over a population that excluded the
    very tests those mutants target.

    This is the unittest load_tests protocol: it wraps each module-level function so
    BOTH runners see the same 433. None of them takes a fixture argument, which is what
    makes FunctionTestCase sufficient; a test that grows one will fail loudly here
    rather than vanish.
