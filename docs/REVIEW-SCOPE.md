# What gets reviewed, and what does not

## Why this file exists

The release rule in the maintainer's global instructions reads: *"Not a review of the
last change, or of the risky-looking part. The whole release surface: every commit since
the previous release, and every file the bundle ships."*

Applied literally, that turns every release review into a **whole-repository audit**.
MEASURED on the v3.0.0 round-6 review, which was aimed at "the 9,163 lines earlier
rounds declared unread":

| | |
|---|---|
| findings | 3 CRITICAL + 13 IMPORTANT |
| of those, **predating the 3.0 arc** | **15 of 19 defect sites** (oldest 2026-06-23) |
| both CRITICALs | **already shipped in v2.8.0**, byte-identical |

So the round spent most of its budget finding defects that were already in users' hands
and that shipping or not shipping v3.0.0 would not change either way. That is a real
audit and worth doing — but it is not a **release gate**, and conflating the two is what
made three consecutive rounds each return ~15 findings and never converge.

**The split this file establishes: a RELEASE review is scoped to what the release
CHANGES. A CODEBASE AUDIT is scoped by blast radius and runs on its own schedule.**

---

## Track 1 — the RELEASE review (gates the release)

**Scope: every production file the arc ADDED or MODIFIED, and nothing else.**
Derive it, never list it from memory:

    BASE=$(git rev-list -n1 <previous release tag>)
    git diff --diff-filter=AM --name-only $BASE..HEAD

A file the arc did not touch cannot contain a regression the arc caused. If it holds a
defect, that defect is already released, and it belongs to Track 2.

**Two things this scope must NOT inherit from a diff-scoped review** (CLAUDE.md #37 --
a diff-scoped review cannot find a defect that predates the diff):

1. A file the arc **modified** is reviewed **in full**, not just its hunks. The arc's
   change may be correct while the function around it is not, and the arc is what puts
   it in front of new users.
2. A subsystem the arc **added** is reviewed in full before its first release, however
   large. MEASURED: `live_query.lua` (2,501 lines) was added on 2026-08-31 and first
   read in round 6 -- it carried 1 CRITICAL + 3 IMPORTANT, every in-arc finding of the
   round.

**Release exit criterion:** zero CRITICAL and zero IMPORTANT **among in-arc findings**.
Pre-existing findings are recorded to Track 2 and do not hold the release.

## Track 2 — the CODEBASE AUDIT (does not gate any release)

Ranked by one question: **does a defect here produce a confidently wrong FACT?**
That is the maintainer's criterion -- "the tools that are actually going to be spitting
truth values at us and declaring something is factual or not" -- and it sorts the repo
better than size or age does.

### Tier 1 — ORACLES. A defect writes a wrong fact into permanent record.

> ⚠ **THESE LINE COUNTS ARE A SNAPSHOT, NOT AN INVARIANT, and the claim that they
> could "never disagree" with `COVERAGE.tsv` was itself false when written.**
> Corrected 2026-09-06 (second pass): counted with `audit-coverage.py::line_count`,
> three of twelve entries matched NO commit anywhere in `v3.0.0..HEAD` at the moment
> the invariance sentence was added -- `_freshness.py` 678 (really 727),
> `_provenance.py` 119 (118), `_nexus.py` 240 (250). Four later commits in the same
> arc then moved `_compat.py` (906 -> 852), `_effective.py` (897 -> 977) and
> `_merge.py` (974 -> 1013) with no re-pin.
>
> **Use them for TIERING, which is what they are for, and re-derive before quoting
> one as a fact.** A page cannot pin a number in a tree that keeps moving; only
> `audit-coverage.py` can, because it derives the population from `git ls-tree` at a
> named rev and REFUSES a ledger that disagrees. Found by the v3.1.0 release
> reviewer, which is the second time this page's own numbers rotted.

| file | lines | why it ranks here |
|---|---|---|
| `_compat.py` | 906 | computes LOAD ORDER -- decides who wins every conflict (#13) |
| `_effective.py` | 897 | builds the effective tree every "effective value" claim quotes |
| `_merge.py` | 974 | applies diffs; where 858 dropped-ops-reported-applied lived |
| `_resolve.py` | 247 | reference resolution (partial coverage only) |
| `_diff.py` | 188 | the diff primitive |
| `_xpath.py` | 46 | the selector primitive |

~3,258 lines. **Highest-value review in the repository.** Every Three-Values answer,
every Tier B verdict and every provenance claim rests on these six. All shipped since
v2.5.0, so none is a release blocker -- and all are load-bearing for correctness.

### Tier 2 — INSTRUMENTS. A defect means a gate cannot go red.

`gates/` (31 files, ~7,146 lines), `scripts/run-gates.sh`, `verify-cold.sh`,
`fuzz-guard.py`. Review the **contract**, not the logic: for each gate ask *what,
concretely, would make this go red?* (#26). MEASURED precedent -- round 5's B5 found a
FALSE OK that could not fail the run; round 6 found `qa_sweep` accepting
`expect=(0,1,3)` and `--sel-only` declared but never read. Both are cells with no
reachable failing branch.

### Tier 3 — FRESHNESS / PROVENANCE. A defect makes a stale artifact read as current.

`_freshness.py` (678, partial), `_provenance.py` (119).

### Tier 4 — REPORTING CLIs. A defect produces visibly wrong output.

`_effectivecli.py`, `_debugcli.py`, `_savecli.py`, `_diffcli.py`, `_changed.py`,
`_threeway.py`, `_debuglog.py`. Lower priority **because a wrong number on screen is
seen, while a wrong fact in the store is not.**

## Explicitly OUT of scope for human review

| | lines | why, and what covers it instead |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/` | 23,796 | **Not read. Swept MECHANICALLY.** A test that does not assert is exactly a tool declaring something factual when it is not -- so the risk is real, but it is a SHAPE, and shapes are better caught by an AST scan over all 107 files than by reading any of them. Sweeps: bare `return` as a precondition bail (round 5's B6 -- 3 tests reported PASSED without asserting), an assertion satisfied by a COMMENT or docstring (round 5's B7), `assert` on a substring where a structure is meant, and a mutation that leaves the named test green. `tests/test_no_bare_return_in_a_test.py` is the pattern to extend. |
| `tools/basex/` | 3,151 | Discovery, not proof -- its answers are never quoted as facts without a denominator. **Exception: `ask.py` is Tier 2**, since refusing a zero-result without coverage is the standard the rest of the repo is measured against. |
| `_nexus.py` | 240 | External API client. A defect yields a failed lookup, not a wrong local fact. |
| vendored `BaseX.jar` | -- | Third-party binary, BSD-3-Clause. Not ours to review. |

## The rule that makes this converge

**Record every finding with its ORIGIN, measured, not assumed:**

    git blame -L <line>,<line> --porcelain -- <file>

and bucket it IN-ARC or PRE-ARC against an explicit `<tag>..HEAD` range. Never
`--since`: it filters on COMMITTER date while `--date=short` prints AUTHOR date, which
silently drops commits and mis-reports a file as untouched (#37).

A review that does not separate the two will keep re-finding the repository's whole
history at every release, and will read as "the fixes are causing new bugs" when the
measured answer is the opposite.

### ★ The third bucket: a PRE-ARC defect this release RECRUITS FOR

IN-ARC and PRE-ARC are not exhaustive, and the gap between them shipped once already.
**A defect can be old while the thing that makes users REACH it is new** — and those two
halves blame to different commits, so a review that blames only the defect will bucket
the whole finding PRE-ARC and wave it through.

> **The case (2026-09-07, v3.1.0).** `install.sh` cannot run over an install that
> `scripts/x4lock.py` has locked: it has no `trap`, so a failure between the backup and
> the restore skips the restore, and it dies on the first item with
> `cp: … Permission denied`. Blamed correctly to `2d4582b`, an ancestor of v3.0.0, with
> `x4lock` itself shipping IN v3.0.0. PRE-ARC, therefore not a gate, therefore ship it.
>
> **MEASURED, and it inverts the conclusion: `git show v3.0.0:README.md | grep -ci x4lock`
> is ZERO.** The line telling users to lock their files was added in the release under
> review, hours before. v3.1.0 was not merely the first upgrade over a locked install —
> it was the first release that INSTRUCTS people into the state that breaks the upgrade.
> The defect is old; its blast radius is new, and the commit that widened it is in-arc.

**So ask two questions of every PRE-ARC finding, not one:**

1. When was the DEFECT introduced? (`git blame` on the broken line.)
2. When was the thing that makes users ENCOUNTER it introduced? A new doc line, a new
   default, a new install step, a newly-advertised feature, a new code path that reaches
   old code. `git show <tag>:<file>` on the DOCS, not only on the source.

If (1) is pre-arc and (2) is in-arc, the finding is **in-arc for triage purposes** even
though not one line of the defective code changed. Fix the half that is yours — usually
the recruitment, which is usually cheap — and say plainly which half you left.

⚠ **The reviewer who found this had the right defect and the wrong baseline**, reading
the README from the WORKING TREE and treating it as shipped state. That is #34's family
one level out: not "what an instrument returned" standing in for a fact, but "what the
repo says today" standing in for "what the last release said". `git show <tag>:<path>`
is the whole remedy and it costs nothing.
