# Regression test for protect-bash.sh.   Run:  bash .claude/hooks/test-protect-bash.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A PreToolUse hook sits in front of EVERY Bash call, so its two
# failure modes are both expensive and both silent-ish:
#   over-block  -> legitimate work becomes impossible, and the fix is not obvious
#   under-block -> the guard is decorative and you trust it anyway
# The must-NOT-fire cases below are therefore the important half, not the padding.
#
# It has already earned its keep twice:
#   1. The first draft of the `$?`-after-a-pipeline rule FALSE-FIRED on
#      `cat >> f.md <<'EOF' | a | b | EOF; echo $?` -- a markdown table inside a
#      heredoc, a shape used constantly in this workspace. Fixed by stripping
#      heredoc BODIES before looking for a pipeline.
#   2. The first version of THIS harness reported 7 spurious failures, because a
#      hook that correctly stays silent produces NO stdout, and `jq '... // "allow"'`
#      over empty input yields empty rather than the default. The harness was wrong,
#      not the hook -- see KNOWLEDGEBASE 2026-08-22b, "check the checker first".
