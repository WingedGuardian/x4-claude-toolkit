"""x4guard -- one front door to the toolkit's guards (Layer 0 of the agent-portability design).

    python x4guard.py check --kind shell --shell {bash,powershell} --command CMD
    python x4guard.py check --kind {write,delete} --path P
    python x4guard.py check --kind write --path P {--content WHOLE_FILE | --command PATCH_TEXT}
    python x4guard.py conformance --profile NAME|PATH [-- ADAPTER ARGV]   (see ADAPTING.md)

`check` prints ONE JSON verdict and exits 0:
    {"v":1,"decision":"allow|advise|ask|deny","reason":...,"context":...,"inert":bool,"guards":[...]}
Exit 2 only on a usage error. (`conformance` has its own exit codes: 0 agree, 1 disagree,
2 cannot evaluate, 3 too little examined -- scripts/x4conformance.py.) `check` runs the SAME guard scripts Claude Code runs, with the payload
shape they already read, and NO side effects: backup-before-edit.sh is never run by a check.

--shell names the shell that will EXECUTE the command, not the tool that sent it. Codex, for
one, labels PowerShell commands "Bash" (MEASURED 2026-09-30); judged as bash, a PowerShell
write into reference/ was allowed.

A guard that could not run is never an allow: missing script, no bash, the WSL bash stub, a
timeout, a non-zero exit, unreadable output or an invalid X4_GUARD_TIMEOUT_S all return
decision "deny" with inert=true and the cause named.

X4_GUARD_TIMEOUT_S (default 25, a positive number of seconds) is the budget for the WHOLE
check: a delete's two guards share it. On a timeout the guard and every descendant are killed:
on Windows through a Job Object the guard starts in (MSYS descendants included, which
`taskkill /T` cannot see -- R2-F4), falling back to `taskkill /T` if no job could be made; on
POSIX through the guard's own process group, which a descendant that calls setsid() leaves.
The worst-case wall clock is that budget plus KILL_WAIT_S + DRAIN_GRACE_S. An agent that can ask its user may present an inert deny as a question; it may
not present it as an allow. Stdlib only; Python >= 3.10.
