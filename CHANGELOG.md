# Changelog

## v1.1

Bug fixes from a cold-start install red-team (a no-context agent following only the shipped
docs), which surfaced gaps invisible from the inside.

### Fixed
- **`x4validate` no longer false-passes when the reference tree is missing or empty.** It used
  to report `OK: no issues found` (exit 0) even on a `sel=` that matched nothing, because there
  was nothing to match against — the exact silent-no-op the tool exists to catch, in the tool
  itself. It now errors and exits non-zero until a real `reference\` is present. (+ regression
  tests.)
- **`protect-files` hook now actually fires.** The game-install block used a PCRE lookahead
  invalid under `grep -E`, so it never triggered; path matching was also tied to one personal
  workspace layout. Reworked to anchor on `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, so the `reference\` read-only
  block and the workspace whitelist work at any install location.

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` reconciled to the "workspace under the project root" layout and to the
  protections that actually exist; removed a hardcoded x4validate test count from docs.

## v1.0

Initial release. An AI-assisted X4: Foundations modding environment for Claude Code,
distilled from hands-on mod development on X4 v9.0.

### Included
- **~500-line `KNOWLEDGEBASE.md`** — X4 XML schema patterns, diff-patch idioms, the
  extension merge/load-order model, the 7.x→9.0 version migration map, a mechanics
  interlock map, and tool notes. Auto-loaded every session.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — the modding workflow: diff-patch-first, confidence levels,
  "vanilla as frame of reference," native-engine-solutions-first, and the cognitive
  co-pilot principle.
- **`x4validate`** (bundled, Python/uv/lxml) — cross-file validator: checks every diff
  `sel=` resolves against the real base+DLC merged tree, that ware/macro/`{page,t}`
  references resolve, and completeness of new content vs a vanilla analogue. Also ships
  `x4modlist` (mod-registry triage via the Nexus API) and an XSD-based 7.x→9.0 migration
  checker.
- **4 skills** — `/x4-debug`, `/x4-modlist-review`, `/x4-scaffold`, `/x4-update-mod`.
- **2 subagents** — `cross-file-impact`, `mod-research`.
- **Safety hooks** — protect-bash, protect-files, auto-backup-with-audit-log,
  reference-version check (SessionStart), and advisory x4validate-on-edit.
- **`scripts/generate-baseline.sh`** — capture a known-good baseline (game version,
  installed-mod hashes, a normalized debug.txt error fingerprint) to diff against later.
- **`setup.sh`** — checks prerequisites (jq, uv/Python), wires up x4validate, and
  personalizes local paths.

### Notes
- Ships **no** Egosoft game data. `reference\` is unpacked locally from your own copy.
- All Nexus access is via the official API with **your own** API key (`X4_NEXUS_KEY`);
  no key is bundled.
